# Setting Up Weaviate with Docker on macOS

This guide explains how to set up and run Weaviate in a Docker container on macOS. It also covers installing dependencies and verifying the setup.

---

## **Prerequisites**
Ensure you have the following installed on your macOS system:
- **Docker** ([Download Here](https://www.docker.com/get-started/))
- **Python 3.8+** ([Download Here](https://www.python.org/downloads/))

To check if Docker is installed, run:
```sh
docker --version
```
If Docker is not installed, download and install it from the link above.

---

## **Step 1: Start Weaviate Using Docker**

Run the following command to pull and start Weaviate with OpenAI text vectorization:
```sh
docker run -d --rm --name weaviate -e AUTHENTICATION_ANONYMOUS_ACCESS_ENABLED=true \
    -e PERSISTENCE_DATA_PATH=/var/lib/weaviate \
    -e QUERY_DEFAULTS_LIMIT=25 \
    -e ENABLE_MODULES=text2vec-openai \
    -e OPENAI_APIKEY=<your-openai-key> \
    -p 8080:8080 semitechnologies/weaviate:1.22.1
```
Replace `<your-openai-key>` with your OpenAI API key.

To verify Weaviate is running, execute:
```sh
docker ps | grep weaviate
```
You should see a running Weaviate container.

---

## **Step 2: Install Python Dependencies**

To interact with Weaviate, install the required Python packages:
```sh
pip install weaviate-client
```
To verify installation:
```sh
python -c "import weaviate; print('Weaviate client installed successfully')"
```

---

## **Step 3: Test Connection to Weaviate**
Create a Python script (`test_weaviate.py`) to verify connectivity:
```python
import weaviate

client = weaviate.Client("http://localhost:8080")

if client.is_ready():
    print("‚úÖ Weaviate is ready!")
else:
    print("‚ùå Weaviate is not running. Check Docker container.")
```
Run the script:
```sh
python test_weaviate.py
```
If successful, you should see:
```sh
‚úÖ Weaviate is ready!
```

---

## **Step 4: Stop and Restart Weaviate**
To stop Weaviate, run:
```sh
docker stop weaviate
```
To restart Weaviate, run the original `docker run` command again.

---

## **Troubleshooting**
### **1. Docker is not running**
Run:
```sh
open -a Docker
```
Wait for Docker to fully start, then retry running Weaviate.

### **2. Port 8080 is in use**
Check if another process is using port 8080:
```sh
lsof -i :8080
```
If occupied, stop the process or run Weaviate on a different port (`-p 9090:8080`).

## Clean up Docker

### üõë **How to Clean Up Docker When You're Done** üõë

If you're finished with Weaviate or other Docker containers, follow these steps to **clean up your system** and **free up disk space**.

---

## **üßπ Step 1: Stop and Remove the Weaviate Container**
1. **Find the running Weaviate container**:
   ```sh
   docker ps
   ```
   - Look for a container with the **name** or **image** related to Weaviate (e.g., `weaviate/weaviate`).

2. **Stop the Weaviate container**:
   ```sh
   docker stop <container_id>
   ```
   - Replace `<container_id>` with the actual container ID from the `docker ps` command.

3. **Remove the stopped Weaviate container**:
   ```sh
   docker rm <container_id>
   ```
   - This removes the container instance but **not the image**.

---

## **üóëÔ∏è Step 2: Remove Unused Docker Images**
If you **want to remove the Weaviate image**, run:
```sh
docker images
```
Find the **Weaviate image ID** and remove it:
```sh
docker rmi <image_id>
```

---

## **üõ†Ô∏è Step 3: Remove Docker Networks & Volumes (Optional)**
To **delete any Docker networks** associated with Weaviate:
```sh
docker network prune
```

To **delete any Docker volumes** associated with Weaviate:
```sh
docker volume prune
```

---

## **üöÄ Step 4: Full Cleanup (Only If Needed)**
If you **want to completely clean up all stopped containers, unused images, networks, and volumes**, run:
```sh
docker system prune -a
```
‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** This will remove **all unused containers, images, volumes, and networks**, so use it with caution!

---

## **‚úÖ Step 5: Verify Cleanup**
To check that Weaviate is gone:
```sh
docker ps -a  # Should not list Weaviate
docker images  # Should not list Weaviate image
```

Now, your system is **clean and free of Docker leftovers**!

---



## **Next Steps**
You now have Weaviate running in Docker on macOS. Next, you can:
- Load data into Weaviate
- Perform vector searches
- Integrate with AI models for semantic retrieval
