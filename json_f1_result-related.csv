There are two scenarios where people ask for a multi-user cluster model. Scenario #1: Many users accessing a cluster for serving data for BI purposes. The easiest way of accomplishing this task is to cook the data with Spark and then take advantage of the serving capabilities of Synapse SQL to that they can connect Power BI to those datasets. Scenario #2: Having multiple developers on a single cluster to save money. To satisfy this scenario, you should give each developer a serverless Spark pool that is set to use a small number of Spark resources.

After the organization takes over a viral tenant, only an administrator in that organization can reset the user's password or enable SSPR. If necessary, as the inviting organization, you can remove the guest user account from your directory and resend an invitation. 
 
 If the guest user's home directory is your Microsoft Entra tenant, you can reset the user's password. For example, you might have created a user or synced a user from your on-premises Active Directory and set their UserType to Guest. Because this user is homed in your directory, you can reset their password from the Microsoft Entra admin center.

An organization might want to have different experiences in their applications for tenant users and guest users. Is there standard guidance for this? Is the presence of the identity provider claim the correct model to use?,"A guest user can use any identity provider to authenticate. For more information, see  Properties of a B2B collaboration user . Use the  UserType  property to determine user experience. The  UserType  claim isn't currently included in the token. Applications should use the Microsoft Graph API to query the directory for the user, and to get the UserType.","A guest user can use any identity provider to authenticate.

"Can we send an invitation that is automatically redeemed, so that the user is just âready to goâ? Or does the user always have to click through to the redemption URL?","You can invite other users in the partner organization by using the UI, PowerShell scripts, or APIs.

What happens if I invite a user whose email and UPN donât match?,"It depends. By default, Microsoft Entra-only allows UPN for login ID. When UPN and email are the same, Microsoft Entra B2B invitations and subsequent sign-ins work as expected. However, issues can arise when a userâs email and UPN donât match, and the email is used instead of the UPN to sign in.
When a user is invited with a non-UPN email, they will be able to redeem the invitation if they redeem using the  email invitation link , but redemptions via a  direct link  will fail. However, even if the user successfully redeems the invitation, subsequent sign-in attempts using the non-UPN email will fail unless the identity provider (either Microsoft Entra ID or a federated identity provider) is configured to allow email as an alternative login ID.
This issue can be mitigated by: 
 
 Enabling email as an alternate login ID  in the invited/home Microsoft Entra tenant 
 Enabling the federated identity provider to support email as login ID (if Microsoft Entra ID is federated to another identity provider) or 
 Instructing the user to redeem/sign-in using their UPN. 
 
 To avoid this issue entirely, administrators should ensure usersâ UPN and email are the same value. 
 
 
 
 Note 
 Invitations and redemptions being sent across Microsoft clouds must use UPN. Email is not supported at this time. For example, if a user from a US Government tenant is invited to a Commercial tenant, the user must be invited using their UPN.

Instant-on: What can cause replication latency?,"In the B2B collaboration flows, we add users to the directory and dynamically update them during the invitation redemption process, app assignment, and so on. The updates and writes ordinarily happen in one directory instance and must be replicated across all instances. Replication is completed once all instances are updated. Sometimes when the object is written or updated in one instance and the call to retrieve this object is to another instance, replication latencies can occur. If that happens, refresh or retry to help. If you are writing an app using our API, then retries with some back-off is a good, defensive practice to alleviate this issue.","In the B2B collaboration flows, we add users to the directory and dynamically update them during the invitation redemption process, app assignment, and so on.
