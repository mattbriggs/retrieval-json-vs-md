Only the guest user or an administrator in the user\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home directory can reset the password. Here are some examples of how password reset works for guest users: \n \n Guest users in a Microsoft Entra tenant that are marked \"Guest\" (UserType==Guest) can't register for SSPR through  https://aka.ms/ssprsetup . These type of guest user can only perform SSPR through  https://aka.ms/sspr . \n \n Guest users who sign in with a Microsoft account (for example guestuser@live.com) can reset their own passwords using Microsoft account self-service password reset (SSPR). See  How to reset your Microsoft account password . \n \n Guest users who sign in with a Google account or another external identity provider can reset their own passwords using their identity provider's SSPR method. For example, a guest user with the Google account guestuser@gmail.com can reset their password by following the instructions in  Change or reset your password . \n \n If the identity tenant is a just-in-time (JIT) or \"viral\" tenant (meaning it's a separate, unmanaged Azure tenant), only the guest user can reset their password. Sometimes an organization will  take over management of viral tenants  that are created when employees use their work email addresses to sign up for services. After the organization takes over a viral tenant, only an administrator in that organization can reset the user's password or enable SSPR. If necessary, as the inviting organization, you can remove the guest user account from your directory and resend an invitation. \n \n If the guest user's home directory is your Microsoft Entra tenant, you can reset the user's password. For example, you might have created a user or synced a user from your on-premises Active Directory and set their UserType to Guest. Because this user is homed in your directory, you can reset their password from the Microsoft Entra admin center. \n \n",
