Once you sign up for an Azure subscription, you can add an API for NoSQL container to your Azure subscription. Software development kits (SDKs)are available for .NET, Python, Node.js, JavaScript, Go, and Java. Developers can also use theREST APIto interact with Azure Cosmos DB resources from more platforms and languages. Check out these QuickStart code samples and templates for the API for NoSQL: Yes, the API for NoSQL allows applications to store arbitrary JSON documents as items without schema definitions or hints. The data is immediately available for query with the Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL query language. Yes, the API for NoSQL supports cross-document transactions expressed using either batches in the SDKs or as JavaScript-stored procedures and triggers. Transactions are scoped to a single partition within each container and executed with ACID semantics as ""all or nothing,"" isolated from other concurrently executing code and user requests. If exceptions occur, the entire transaction is rolled back. You can create databases by using one of these tools: Yes! Azure Cosmos DB supports Microsoft Entra authentication to manage the service and its resources (control-plane) and to execute data, operations, and queries (data-plane).
Control-plane authentication is performed using therole-based access controlfeature of Azure. You can use a preconfigured built-in role](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md) or you cancreate a custom role. With Azure role-based access control, you can manage accounts, databases, containers, and metadata. The control-plane includes operations including, but not limited to these examples. Structured Query Language (SQL) is a language typically used to query relational data. The API for NoSQL has a customNoSQLquery language derived from SQL. The NoSQL query language includes a subset of the SQL query language typically associated with SQL Server along with various NoSQL-specific enhancements. The NoSQL query language provides rich hierarchical and relational operators and extensibility via JavaScript-based, user-defined functions (UDFs). JSON grammar allows for modeling JSON documents as trees with labeled nodes, which are used by both the Azure Cosmos DB automatic indexing techniques and the SQL query dialect of Azure Cosmos DB. For information about using this query language, seeNoSQL Query. The API for NoSQL supports aggregation via aggregate functions such as:COUNT,MAX,AVG, andSUMvia the NoSQL query language. The API for NoSQL supports optimistic concurrency control (OCC) through HTTP entity tags, orETags. Every API for NoSQL resource has an ETag, and the ETag is set on the server every time a document is updated. The ETag header and the current value are included in all response messages. ETags can be used with theIf-Matchheader to allow the server to decide whether a resource should be updated. The If-Match value is the ETag value to be checked against. If the ETag value matches the server ETag value, the resource is updated. If the ETag is no longer current, the server rejects the operation with an ""HTTP 412 Precondition failure"" response code. The client then refetches the resource to acquire the current ETag value for the resource. In addition, ETags can be used with theIf-None-Matchheader to determine whether its needed to refetch a resource. Most of the API for NoSQL SDKs includes classes to manage optimistic concurrency control. Use the bulk import feature in the.NET SDKor theJava SDKfor the API for NoSQL to import large sets of data. This feature optimizes provisioned throughput to import large sets of data. Alternatively, useApache Sparkto import data at scale using Python or Scala. Yes, because Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL is a RESTful service, resource links are immutable and can be cached. API for NoSQL clients can specify an ""If-None-Match"" header for reads against any resource-like document or container and then update their local copies after the server version changes. Yes. TheAzure Cosmos DB emulatorprovides a high-fidelity emulation of the Azure Cosmos DB service. It supports functionality that's identical to Azure Cosmos DB across various APIs. This functionality includes support for creating items, querying items, provisioning containers, and scaling containers. You can develop and test applications by using the emulator's endpoints. You can then deploy the applications to Azure at a global scale by changing the connection string from the emulator to the live service. This Data Explorer limitation is a limitation of JavaScript. JavaScript uses double-precision floating-point format numbers as specified in Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 754. This data type can safely hold numbers between -(253- 1) and 253-1 (that is, 9007199254740991) only. Role-based access control (RBAC) is a method of regulating access to computer or network resources based on the roles of individual users within an enterprise. In Azure Cosmos DB, RBAC is used to grant data-plane access to users and applications. For more information about various terms in role-based access control, see thesecurity glossary.

What are the functional differences between dedicated SQL pools and serverless pools?,You can find a full list of differences inT-SQL feature differences in Synapse SQL.,"Applies to:Azure SQL Database The schema info object is only used to split merge scenarios. If an application is inherently single-tenant, then it does not require the Split Merge tool and thus there is no need to populate the schema info object. Please seeAdding a shard to an application using the elastic database client library. Using the elastic database client library does not incur any costs. Costs accrue only for the databases in Azure SQL Database that you use for shards and the Shard Map Manager, as well as the web/worker roles you provision for the Split Merge tool. Do not use credentials in the form of ""User ID=username@servername"", instead simply use ""User ID = username"".  Also, be sure that the ""username"" login has permissions on the shard. Noâ€”the creation of the Shard Map Manager (for example,ShardMapManagerFactory.CreateSqlShardMapManager) is a one-time operation.  Your application should use the callShardMapManagerFactory.TryGetSqlShardMapManager()at application start-up time.  There should be only one such call per application domain. Please reach out to us on theMicrosoft Q&A question page for SQL Database. The Elastic Scale APIs give you a connection to the correct database for your sharding key, but do not provide sharding key filtering.  AddWHEREclauses to your query to restrict the scope to the provided sharding key, if necessary. Yes, a shard is an individual database, and thus one shard could be a Premium edition while another be a Standard edition. Further, the edition of a shard can scale up or down multiple times during the lifetime of the shard. No. Forsplitoperations, the target database must exist with the appropriate schema and be registered with the Shard Map Manager.  Formergeoperations, you must delete the shard from the shard map manager and then delete the database. Not using elastic database tools yet? Check out ourGetting Started Guide.  For questions, contact us on theMicrosoft Q&A question page for SQL Databaseand for feature requests, add new ideas or vote for existing ideas in theSQL Database feedback forum.

"What are Delta tables, and why should I use them?","Lakehouse is based on open direct-access data formats, such as Apache Parquet. It has first-class support for machine learning and data science. A Delta table is a view of data that is contained in a Delta Lake, which supports most options provided by Apache Spark DataFrame read and write APIs. Lakehouses can help with major challenges with data warehouses, like data staleness, reliability, total cost of ownership, and data lock-in. On Delta tables, optimizations like auto compaction and adaptive query plans are available. For a detailed guide to Delta Lake, please visitDelta Lake Guide.","APPLIES TO:Table There are some behavior differences that users coming from Azure Table storage who want to create tables with the Azure Cosmos DB for Table should be aware of: Azure Cosmos DB for Table uses a reserved capacity model in order to ensure guaranteed performance but this means that one pays for the capacity as soon as the table is created, even if the capacity isn't being used. With Azure Table storage one only pays for capacity that's used. This helps to explain why API for Table can offer a 10 ms read and 15 ms write SLA at the 99th percentile while Azure Table storage offers a 10-second SLA. But as a consequence, with API for Table tables, even empty tables without any requests, cost money in order to ensure the capacity is available to handle any requests to them at the SLA offered by Azure Cosmos DB. Query results returned by the API for Table aren't sorted in partition key/row key order as they are in Azure Table storage. Row keys can only be up to 255 bytes. Batches can only have up to 2 MBs. CORS isn't currently supported. Table names in Azure Table storage aren't case-sensitive, but they are in Azure Cosmos DB for Table. Some of Azure Cosmos DB's internal formats for encoding information, such as binary fields, are currently not as efficient as one might like. Therefore this can cause unexpected limitations on data size. For example, currently one couldn't use the full one Meg of a table entity to store binary data because the encoding increases the data's size. Azure Cosmos DB reserves the entity property namesID,rid,etag, andResourceIdand they're currently not supported. TableQuery TakeCount isn't limited to 1000. In terms of the REST API, Azure Table storage (but not Azure Cosmos DB for Table) supports the following endpoints/query options: Azure Cosmos DB for Table only supports the JSON format, not ATOM. For the .NET SDK in particular, there are some classes and methods that Azure Cosmos DB doesn't currently support. No, existing storage SDKs should still work. However, it's recommended that one always gets the latest SDKs for the best support and in many cases superior performance. See the list of available languages in theIntroduction to Azure Cosmos DB for Table. The connection string is: You can get the connection string from the Connection String page in the Azure portal. Some settings are handled on the CreateCloudTableClient method and other via the app.config in the appSettings section in the client application. For information about config settings, seeAzure Cosmos DB capabilities. None. There are no changes for existing or new customers who are using the existing Azure Table storage SDKs. You can use the Azure portal to browse the data. You can also use the API for Table code or the tools mentioned in the next answer. You can use theAzure Storage Explorer. Tools with the flexibility to take a connection string in the format specified previously can support the new API for Table. A list of table tools is provided on theAzure Storage Client Toolspage. Yes, optimistic concurrency is provided via the use of the ETag mechanism. Yes, the API for Table supports OData query and LINQ query. Yes, you can connect by creating two separate instances of the CloudTableClient, each pointing to its own URI via the connection string. AzCopyis supported. Azure Cosmos DB is designed to provide unlimited storage via the use of horizontal scaling. The service can monitor and effectively increase your storage. You can use the API for TableMetricspane to monitor requests and storage usage. You can use the capacity estimator to calculate the TableThroughput that's required for the operations. For more information, seeEstimate Request Units and Data Storage. In general, you can show your entity as JSON and provide the numbers for your operations. Not at this time. Yes, the same API is supported. No, you can create and use existing Azure Table storage assets without interruption of any kind. However, if you don't use the API for Table, you can't benefit from the automatic index, the extra consistency option, or global distribution. You can use the Azure Cosmos DB portal's global replication settings to add regions that are suitable for your application. To develop a globally distributed application, you should also add your application with the PreferredLocation information set to the local region for providing low read latency. You can use the Azure Cosmos DB global replication portal pane to add a region and then fail over to the required region. For instructions, seeDeveloping with multi-region Azure Cosmos DB accounts. To help read from the local location, use the PreferredLocation key in the app.config file. For existing applications, the API for Table throws an error if LocationMode is set. Remove that code, because the API for Table picks up this information from the app.config file. Azure Cosmos DB provides well-reasoned trade-offs between consistency, availability, and latency. Azure Cosmos DB offers five consistency levels to API for Table developers, so you can choose the right consistency model at the table level and make individual requests while querying the data. When a client connects, it can specify a consistency level. You can change the level via the consistencyLevel argument of CreateCloudTableClient. The API for Table provides low-latency reads with ""Read your own writes,"" with Bounded-staleness consistency as the default. For more information, seeConsistency levels. By default, Azure Table storage provides Strong consistency within a region and Eventual consistency in the secondary locations. Yes, for information about how to benefit from the distributed nature of Azure Cosmos DB, seeConsistency levels. Because guarantees are provided for the consistency levels, you can use them with confidence. Azure Cosmos DB commits the data durably in the local region and pushes the data to other regions immediately in a matter of milliseconds. This replication is dependent only on the round-trip time (RTT) of the datacenter. To learn more about the global-distribution capability of Azure Cosmos DB, seeAzure Cosmos DB: A globally distributed database service on Azure. With Azure Cosmos DB, you can set the consistency level at the container level (on the table). By using the .NET SDK, you can change the level by providing the value for TableConsistencyLevel key in the app.config file. The possible values are: Strong, Bounded Staleness, Session, Consistent Prefix, and Eventual. For more information, seeTunable data consistency levels in Azure Cosmos DB. The key idea is that you can't set the request consistency level at more than the setting for the table. For example, you can't set the consistency level for the table at Eventual and the request consistency level at Strong. The API for Table uses the globally distributed platform of Azure Cosmos DB. To ensure that your application can tolerate datacenter downtime, enable at least one more region for the account in the Azure Cosmos DB portalDeveloping with multi-region Azure Cosmos DB accounts. You can set the priority of the region by using the portalDeveloping with multi-region Azure Cosmos DB accounts. You can add as many regions as you want for the account and control where it can fail over to by providing a failover priority. To use the database, you need to provide an application there too. When you do so, your customers won't experience downtime. Thelatest .NET client SDKis auto homing but the other SDKs aren't. That is, it can detect the region that's down and automatically fail over to the new region. Yes, the API for Table uses the platform of Azure Cosmos DB for backups. Backups are made automatically. For more information, seeOnline backup and restore with Azure Cosmos DB. Yes, all attributes of an entity are indexed by default. For more information, seeAzure Cosmos DB: Indexing policies. Yes, Azure Cosmos DB for Table provides automatic indexing of all attributes without any schema definition. This automation frees developers to focus on the application rather than on index creation and management. For more information, seeAzure Cosmos DB: Indexing policies. Yes, you can change the indexing policy by providing the index definition. You need to properly encode and escape the settings. The indexing policy can only be set in the portal atData Explorer, navigate to the specific table you want to change and then go to theScale & Settings->Indexing Policy, make the desired change and thenSave. The API for Table provides the same query functionality as Azure Table storage. Azure Cosmos DB also supports sorting, aggregates, geospatial query, hierarchy, and a wide range of built-in functions. For more information, seeSQL queries. You should change TableThroughput when either of the following conditions applies: Yes, you can use the Azure Cosmos DB portal's scale pane to scale the throughput. For more information, seeSet throughput. Yes, if you don't override the TableThroughput via app.config and don't use a precreated container in Azure Cosmos DB, the service creates a table with throughput of 400. None. There's no change in price for existing Azure Table storage customers. The price depends on the allocated TableThroughput. If the request rate is more than the capacity of the provisioned throughput for the underlying container or a set of containers, you get an error, and the SDK retries the call by applying the retry policy. Azure Cosmos DB sets a default throughput for your container if you don't provide one in the app.config file or via the portal. Azure Cosmos DB provides guarantees for performance and latency, with upper bounds on operation. This guarantee is possible when the engine can enforce governance on the tenant's operations. Setting TableThroughput ensures that you get the guaranteed throughput and latency, because the platform reserves this capacity and guarantees operational success. By using the throughput specification, you can elastically change it to benefit from the seasonality of your application, meet the throughput needs, and save costs. Azure Cosmos DB is designed to be a globally distributed, SLA-based system with guarantees for availability, latency, and throughput. When you reserve throughput in Azure Cosmos DB, it's guaranteed, unlike the throughput of other systems. Azure Cosmos DB provides more capabilities that customers have requested, such as secondary indexes and global distribution. Azure Cosmos DB is an SLA-based system that provides unlimited scale, with guarantees for latency, throughput, availability, and consistency. To ensure guaranteed premium performance, make sure that your data size and index are manageable and scalable. The 20-GB limit on the number of entities or items per partition key is to ensure that we provide great lookup and query performance. To ensure that your application scales well, even for Azure Storage, we recommend that younotcreate a hot partition by storing all information in one partition and querying it. Yes. Because the surface area of the API for Table is similar to that of the Azure Table storage SDK, the partition key provides an efficient way to distribute the data. The row key is unique within that partition. The row key needs to be present and can't be null as in the standard SDK. The length of RowKey is 255 bytes and the length of PartitionKey is 1 KB. Azure Table storage and Azure Cosmos DB for Table use the same SDKs so most of the errors are the same. Azure Cosmos DB is an SLA-based system that provides latency, throughput, availability, and consistency guarantees. Because it's a provisioned system, it reserves resources to guarantee these requirements. The rapid rate of creation of tables is detected and throttled. We recommend that you look at the rate of creation of tables and lower it to less than 5 per minute. Remember that the API for Table is a provisioned system. The moment you provision it, you begin to pay for it. You can share your feedback in any of the following ways: Role-based access control (RBAC) is a method of regulating access to computer or network resources based on the roles of individual users within an enterprise. In Azure Cosmos DB, RBAC is used to grant data-plane access to users and applications. For more information about various terms in role-based access control, see thesecurity glossary. Use the Azure Cosmos DB native role-based access control (RBAC) feature to grant data-plane access to users and applications. For more information, seeGrant data-plane role-based access.

What is Auto Compaction?,"Auto Compaction is one of two complementary features of Auto Optimize for Delta tables. After a write to a table succeeds, Auto Compaction can further compact files for partitions that have the most number of small files. Opting in to Auto Compaction is recommended for streaming use cases where adding minutes of latency is acceptable and when you don't have regular OPTIMIZE calls on your table. For more information on Auto Optimize and Auto Compaction, check out thisAuto Optimize Guide.","This article answers frequently asked questions about Windows Autopatch.

How do I ensure I know what credential is being used to run a pipeline?,Each activity in a Synapse Pipeline is executed using the credential specified inside the linked service.,"This article provides answers to some of the most common questions about the Fabric lifecycle management tools. Lifecycle management has two parts, integration and deployment. To understand what integration is in Fabric, refer tothe Git integration overview. To understand what deployment pipelines is in Fabric, refer to thedeployment pipelines overview. For a short explanation of Git integration, see theGit integration overview.A multiline or formatted answer to the question.
Use any Markdown formatting you want, provided
that you maintain the indent on the lines after
the | characters. For a short explanation of deployment pipelines, see thedeployment pipelines overview. For information on licenses, seeFabric licenses. All workspaces must be assigned to a Fabric license. However, you can use different capacity types for different workspaces. For information on capacity types, seeCapacity and SKUs. Note The deployment pipelines permissions model is described thepermissionssection. To configure deployment rules in deployment pipelines, you must be the owner of the semantic model. If the workspace capacity is in one geographic location while the Azure DevOps repo is in another location, the Fabric admin can decide whether to enable cross-geo exports. For more information, seeUsers can export items to Git repositories in other geographical locations. Get started with Git integration using theget started instructions. There could be several reasons why an item was removed from the workspace. These are some important considerations to keep in mind: You can either assign one workspace to your pipeline and deploy it across the pipeline, or assign a different workspace to each pipeline stage. For more information, seeassign a workspace to a deployment pipeline. Datasets that use DirectQuery or Composite connectivity mode and have variation orauto date/timetables aren't supported in deployment pipelines. If your deployment fails and you think it's because you have a dataset with a variation table, you can look for thevariationsproperty in your table's columns. You can use one of the methods listed below to edit your semantic model so that it works in deployment pipelines. In your dataset, instead of using DirectQuery or Composite mode, useimportmode. Remove theauto date/timetables from your semantic model. If necessary, delete any remaining variations from all the columns in your tables. Deleting a variation may invalidate user authored measures, calculated columns and calculated tables. Use this method only if you understand how your semantic model model works as it may result in data corruption in your visuals. When you pin a tile to a dashboard, if the tile relies on an unsupported item (any item not on thislistis unsupported), or on an item that you don't have permissions to deploy, after deploying the dashboard the tile won't render. For example, if you create a tile from a report that relies on a semantic model you're not an admin on, when deploying the report you get an error warning. However, when deploying the dashboard with the tile, you don't an error message, the deployment will succeed, but the tile won't display any information. The owner of a deployed paginated report is the user who deployed the report. When you're deploying a paginated report for the first time, you become the owner of the report. If you're deploying a paginated report to a stage that already contains a copy of that paginated report, you overwrite the previous report and become its owner, instead of the previous owner. In such cases, you need credentials to the underlying data source, so that the data can be used in the paginated report. Paginated report subreports are kept in the same folder that holds your paginated report. To avoid rendering problems, when you're usingselective copyto copy a paginated report with subreports, select both the parent report and the subreports. Paginated report rules can be created if you want to point the paginated report to the semantic model in the same stage. When creating a deployment rule for a paginated report, you need to select a database and a server. If you're setting a deployment rule for a paginated report that doesn't have a Fabric semantic model, because the target data source is external, you need to specify both the server and the database. However, paginated reports that use a Fabric semantic model use an internal semantic model. In such cases, you can't rely on the data source name to identify the Fabric semantic model you're connecting to. The data source name doesn't change when you update it in the target stage, by creating a data source rule or by calling theupdate datasourceAPI. When you set a deployment rule, you need to keep the database format and replace the semantic model object ID in the database field. As the semantic model is internal, the server stays the same. Database- The database format for a paginated report with a Fabric semantic model, issobe_wowvirtualserver-<dataset ID>. For example,sobe_wowvirtualserver-d51fd26e-9124-467f-919c-0c48a99a1d63. Replace the<dataset ID>with your dataset's ID. You can get the dataset ID from the URL, by selecting the GUID that comes afterdatasets/and before the next forward slash.  Server- The server that hosts your database. Keep the existing server as is. After a deployment, if you download the RDL of the paginated report, it might not be updated with the latest version that you can see in Power BI service. When you have a dataflow that contains semantic models that are configured withincremental refresh, the refresh policy isn't copied or overwritten during deployment. After deploying a dataflow that includes a semantic model with incremental refresh to a stage that doesn't include this dataflow, if you have a refresh policy you'll need to reconfigure it in the target stage. If you're deploying a dataflow with incremental refresh to a stage where it already resides, the incremental refresh policy isn't copied. In such cases, if you wish to update the refresh policy in the target stage, you need to do it manually. Deployment pipelines don't display datasets that belong to datamarts in the pipeline stages. When you're deploying a datamart, its dataset is also deployed. You can view your datamart's dataset in the workspace of the stage it's in.

How are Azure Data Factory pipelines and Azure Synapse pipelines different?,"Some examples of differences are support for global parameters, monitoring of Spark Jobs for Data Flow, and Integration Runtime sharing. For more information, check out this doc forData Integration - Synapse vs ADF.","This article provides answers to frequently asked questions about Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric. Data Factory helps you solve complex data integration and ETL scenarios with cloud-scale data movement and data transformation services while data engineering helps you create lake house, use Apache Spark to transform and prepare your data. Differences between each of the Fabric terminologies / experiences are available underMicrosoft Fabric terminology. Microsoft Fabric capacity admins can useMicrosoft Fabric Capacity Metricsapp, also known as the metrics app, to gain visibility into capacity resources. This app enables admins to see how much CPU utilization, processing time, and memory are utilized by data pipelines, dataflows, and other items in their Fabric capacity-enabled workspaces. Gain visibility into overload causes, peak demand times, resource consumption and more and easily identify the most demanding or most popular items. You can separate the different workloads between workspaces and use the roles like member and viewer to have a workspace for data engineering that preps data for a workspace that is used for report or AI training. With the viewer role, you can then consume data from the data engineering workspace. Presently, the virtual network gateway offers an injective method to seamlessly integrate into your virtual network, providing a robust avenue for using private endpoints to establish secure connections to your data stores. It's important to note that the virtual network gateway only accommodates Fabric dataflows at this moment. However, our upcoming initiatives encompass expanding its capabilities to encompass Fabric pipelines. When you use the on-premises data gateway, you can nowconnect to on-premises data sources using dataflows and data pipelines (preview) with Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric. To learn more, referHow to access on-premises data sources in Data Factory. Fabric monthly updates are available at theMicrosoft Fabric Blog. Data Factory pricing in Microsoft Fabricprovides a comprehensive guide to how costs are calculated for Data pipelines and Dataflow Gen2. It includes several pricing examples scenarios to help you understand the pricing model better. What's new and planned for Data Factory in Microsoft Fabricprovides insights into upcoming features and their estimated release timelines over the next few months. Fabric Data Factory allows you to develop pipelines that maximize data movement throughput for your environment. These pipelines fully utilize the following resources: Our current focus involves the active development of CDC capability within Data Factory In Fabric. This forthcoming capability empowers you to move data across multiple data sources combining different copy patterns including bulk/batch copy pattern, incremental/continuous copy pattern (CDC) and real time copy pattern into one 5x5 experience. The Power Query activity within ADF shares similarities with Dataflow Gen2, but it has extra features that enable actions like writing to specific data destinations etc. This comparison aligns more fairly with Dataflow Gen1 (Power BI dataflows or Power Apps dataflows). Have a look here for more details:Differences between Dataflow Gen1 and Dataflow Gen2. In certain user experiences, you may encounter system artifacts not intended for interaction. It's best to disregard these artifacts, as they'll eventually be removed from the Get Data experiences in the future. This error message occurs when the user who created the first dataflow in the workspace hasn't logged in to Fabric for more than 90 days or has left the organization. To resolve it, the user mentioned in the error message should log in to Fabric. If the user has left the organization, pleaseopen a support ticket. Azure Data Factory (ADF) and Azure Synapse pipelines maintain a separate Platform as a Service (PaaS) roadmaps.

How do I migrate existing pipelines from Azure Data Factory to an Azure Synapse workspace?,"At this time, you must manually recreate your Azure Data Factory pipelines and related artifacts by exporting the JSON from the original pipeline and importing it into your Synapse workspace.","This article provides answers to frequently asked questions about Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric. Data Factory helps you solve complex data integration and ETL scenarios with cloud-scale data movement and data transformation services while data engineering helps you create lake house, use Apache Spark to transform and prepare your data. Differences between each of the Fabric terminologies / experiences are available underMicrosoft Fabric terminology. Microsoft Fabric capacity admins can useMicrosoft Fabric Capacity Metricsapp, also known as the metrics app, to gain visibility into capacity resources. This app enables admins to see how much CPU utilization, processing time, and memory are utilized by data pipelines, dataflows, and other items in their Fabric capacity-enabled workspaces. Gain visibility into overload causes, peak demand times, resource consumption and more and easily identify the most demanding or most popular items. You can separate the different workloads between workspaces and use the roles like member and viewer to have a workspace for data engineering that preps data for a workspace that is used for report or AI training. With the viewer role, you can then consume data from the data engineering workspace. Presently, the virtual network gateway offers an injective method to seamlessly integrate into your virtual network, providing a robust avenue for using private endpoints to establish secure connections to your data stores. It's important to note that the virtual network gateway only accommodates Fabric dataflows at this moment.

Is there an equivalent of DButils in Azure Synapse Spark?,"Yes, Azure Synapse Apache Spark provides themssparkutilslibrary. For full documentation of the utility seeIntroduction to Microsoft Spark utilities.","APPLIES TO:NoSQL First you must sign up for an Azure subscription. Once you sign up for an Azure subscription, you can add an API for NoSQL container to your Azure subscription. Software development kits (SDKs)are available for .NET, Python, Node.js, JavaScript, Go, and Java. Developers can also use theREST APIto interact with Azure Cosmos DB resources from more platforms and languages. Check out these QuickStart code samples and templates for the API for NoSQL: Yes, the API for NoSQL allows applications to store arbitrary JSON documents as items without schema definitions or hints. The data is immediately available for query with the Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL query language. Yes, the API for NoSQL supports cross-document transactions expressed using either batches in the SDKs or as JavaScript-stored procedures and triggers. Transactions are scoped to a single partition within each container and executed with ACID semantics as ""all or nothing,"" isolated from other concurrently executing code and user requests. If exceptions occur, the entire transaction is rolled back. You can create databases by using one of these tools: Yes! Azure Cosmos DB supports Microsoft Entra authentication to manage the service and its resources (control-plane) and to execute data, operations, and queries (data-plane).
Control-plane authentication is performed using therole-based access controlfeature of Azure. You can use a preconfigured built-in role](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md) or you cancreate a custom role. With Azure role-based access control, you can manage accounts, databases, containers, and metadata. The control-plane includes operations including, but not limited to these examples. Structured Query Language (SQL) is a language typically used to query relational data. The API for NoSQL has a customNoSQLquery language derived from SQL. The NoSQL query language includes a subset of the SQL query language typically associated with SQL Server along with various NoSQL-specific enhancements. The NoSQL query language provides rich hierarchical and relational operators and extensibility via JavaScript-based, user-defined functions (UDFs). JSON grammar allows for modeling JSON documents as trees with labeled nodes, which are used by both the Azure Cosmos DB automatic indexing techniques and the SQL query dialect of Azure Cosmos DB. For information about using this query language, seeNoSQL Query. The API for NoSQL supports aggregation via aggregate functions such as:COUNT,MAX,AVG, andSUMvia the NoSQL query language. The API for NoSQL supports optimistic concurrency control (OCC) through HTTP entity tags, orETags. Every API for NoSQL resource has an ETag, and the ETag is set on the server every time a document is updated. The ETag header and the current value are included in all response messages. ETags can be used with theIf-Matchheader to allow the server to decide whether a resource should be updated. The If-Match value is the ETag value to be checked against. If the ETag value matches the server ETag value, the resource is updated. If the ETag is no longer current, the server rejects the operation with an ""HTTP 412 Precondition failure"" response code. The client then refetches the resource to acquire the current ETag value for the resource. In addition, ETags can be used with theIf-None-Matchheader to determine whether its needed to refetch a resource. Most of the API for NoSQL SDKs includes classes to manage optimistic concurrency control. Use the bulk import feature in the.NET SDKor theJava SDKfor the API for NoSQL to import large sets of data. This feature optimizes provisioned throughput to import large sets of data. Alternatively, useApache Sparkto import data at scale using Python or Scala. Yes, because Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL is a RESTful service, resource links are immutable and can be cached. API for NoSQL clients can specify an ""If-None-Match"" header for reads against any resource-like document or container and then update their local copies after the server version changes. Yes. TheAzure Cosmos DB emulatorprovides a high-fidelity emulation of the Azure Cosmos DB service. It supports functionality that's identical to Azure Cosmos DB across various APIs. This functionality includes support for creating items, querying items, provisioning containers, and scaling containers. You can develop and test applications by using the emulator's endpoints. You can then deploy the applications to Azure at a global scale by changing the connection string from the emulator to the live service. This Data Explorer limitation is a limitation of JavaScript. JavaScript uses double-precision floating-point format numbers as specified in Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 754. This data type can safely hold numbers between -(253- 1) and 253-1 (that is, 9007199254740991) only. Role-based access control (RBAC) is a method of regulating access to computer or network resources based on the roles of individual users within an enterprise. In Azure Cosmos DB, RBAC is used to grant data-plane access to users and applications. For more information about various terms in role-based access control, see thesecurity glossary. Use the Azure Cosmos DB native role-based access control (RBAC) feature to grant data-plane access to users and applications. For more information, seeGrant data-plane role-based access. As of now, only the NoSQL API is supported. Azure portal support for role management isn't available yet. The .NET V3, Java V4, JavaScript V3, and Python V4.3+ SDKs are currently supported. Yes. Yes.

Can I run a multi-user Spark Cluster in Azure Synapse Analytics?,"Azure Synapse provides purpose-built engines for specific use cases. Apache Spark for Synapse is designed as a job service and not a cluster model.
There are two scenarios where people ask for a multi-user cluster model. Scenario #1: Many users accessing a cluster for serving data for BI purposes. The easiest way of accomplishing this task is to cook the data with Spark and then take advantage of the serving capabilities of Synapse SQL to that they can connect Power BI to those datasets. Scenario #2: Having multiple developers on a single cluster to save money. To satisfy this scenario, you should give each developer a serverless Spark pool that is set to use a small number of Spark resources. Since serverless Spark pools don't cost anything, until they are actively used minimizes the cost when there are multiple developers. The pools share metadata (Spark tables) so they can easily work with each other.","This article provides answers to some of the most common questions about how to runAzure HDInsight. To review the HDInsight clusters types, and the provisioning methods, seeSet up clusters in HDInsight with Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, Apache Kafka, and more. To learn more about deleting a cluster when it's no longer in use, seeDelete a HDInsight cluster. Try to leave at least 30 to 60 minutes between create and delete operations. Otherwise the operation may fail with the following error message: Conflict (HTTP Status Code: 409) error when attempting to delete a cluster immediately after creation of a cluster. If you encounter this error, wait until the newly created cluster is in operational state before attempting to delete it. The appropriate number of cores and other configuration options depend on various factors. For more information, seeCapacity planning for HDInsight clusters. SeeResource types in Azure HDInsight clusters. Yes. To install more components or customize cluster configuration, use: Scripts during or after creation. Scripts are invoked viascript action. Script action is a configuration option you can use from the Azure portal, HDInsight Windows PowerShell cmdlets, or the HDInsight .NET SDK. This configuration option can be used from the Azure portal, HDInsight Windows PowerShell cmdlets, or the HDInsight .NET SDK. HDInsight Application Platformto install applications. For a list of supported components, seeWhat are the Apache Hadoop components and versions available with HDInsight? If you upgrade built-in components or applications that are preinstalled on your cluster, the resulting configuration won't be supported by Microsoft. These system configurations haven't been tested by Microsoft. Try to use a different version of the HDInsight cluster that may already have the upgraded version of the component preinstalled. For example, upgrading Hive as an individual component isn't supported. HDInsight is a managed service, and many services are integrated with Ambari server and tested. Upgrading a Hive on its own causes the indexed binaries of other components to change, and will cause component integration issues on your cluster. No, it's not possible to run Apache Kafka and Apache Spark on the same HDInsight cluster. Create separate clusters for Kafka and Spark to avoid resource contention issues. Open the Ambari Web UI athttps://CLUSTERNAME.azurehdinsight.net, where CLUSTERNAME is the name of your cluster. In the upper-right corner, select admin | Settings.  In the User Settings window, select the new timezone from the Timezone drop down, and then select Save.  To migrate from SQL Server to Azure SQL Database, seeTutorial: Migrate SQL Server to a single database or pooled database in Azure SQL Database offline using DMS. It depends on the type of metastore that your cluster is configured to use. For a default metastore: The default metastore is part of the cluster lifecycle. When you delete a cluster, the corresponding metastore and metadata are also deleted. For a custom metastore: The lifecycle of the metastore isn't tied to a cluster's lifecycle. So, you can create and delete clusters without losing metadata. Metadata such as your Hive schemas persists even after you delete and re-create the HDInsight cluster. For more information, seeUse external metadata stores in Azure HDInsight. No, the policy definition is in the Ranger database, so migrating the Ranger database migrates its policy. Yes, you can migrate a Hive metastore from an ESP to a non-ESP cluster. A Hive metastore is used to store the metadata for data sources that are used by the Hive server. The size requirements depend partly on the number and complexity of your Hive data sources. These items can't be estimated up front. As outlined inHive metastore guidelines, you can start with a S2 tier. The tier provides 50 DTU and 250 GB of storage, and if you see a bottleneck, scale up the database. No, Microsoft supports only Azure SQL Database as an external custom metastore. Yes, you can share custom metastore across multiple clusters as long as they're using the same version of HDInsight. If you block ports 22 and port 23, you won't have SSH access to the cluster. These ports aren't used by HDInsight service. For more information, see the following documents: Ports used by Apache Hadoop services on HDInsight Secure incoming traffic to HDInsight clusters in a virtual network with private endpoint HDInsight management IP addresses Yes, you can deploy more virtual machine within the same subnet as a HDInsight cluster. The following configurations are possible: Edge nodes: You can add another edge node to the cluster, as described inUse empty edge nodes on Apache Hadoop clusters in HDInsight. Standalone nodes:  You can add a standalone virtual machine to the same subnet and access the cluster from that virtual machine by using the private end pointhttps://<CLUSTERNAME>-int.azurehdinsight.net. For more information, seeControl network traffic. No, storing data on a local disk isn't a good idea. If the node fails, all data stored locally will be lost. We recommend storing data in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 or Azure Blob storage, or by mounting an Azure Files share for storing the data. No, you can't. The virtual network should be specified at the time of provisioning. If no virtual network is specified during provisioning, the deployment creates an internal network that isn't accessible from outside. For more information, seeAdd HDInsight to an existing virtual network. For information on malware protection, seeMicrosoft Antimalware for Azure Cloud Services and Virtual Machines. Create a Kerberos keytab for your domain username. You can later use this keytab to authenticate to remote domain-joined clusters without entering a password. The domain name is uppercase: If your TenantName & DomainName are different (example TenantName â€“ bob@CONTOSO.ONMICROSOFT.COM & DomainName â€“ bob@CONTOSOMicrosoft.ONMICROSOFT.COM), you need to add a SALT value using the -s option. Enable Microsoft Entra Domain Services before you can create a HDInsight cluster with ESP. Open-source Hadoop relies on Kerberos for Authentication (as opposed to OAuth). To join VMs to a domain, you must have a domain controller. Microsoft Entra Domain Services is the managed domain controller, and is considered an extension of Microsoft Entra ID. Microsoft Entra Domain Services provides all the Kerberos requirements to build a secure Hadoop cluster in a managed way. HDInsight as a managed service integrates with Microsoft Entra Domain Services to provide security. Using a certificate issued by a certificate authority is recommended. But using a self-signed certificate is also supported on ESP. For more information, see: Enable Microsoft Entra Domain Services Tutorial: Configure secure LDAP for Microsoft Entra Domain Services managed domain No, DAS is not supported on ESP clusters. For auditing requirements, Microsoft recommends enabling Azure Monitor logs as described inUse Azure Monitor logs to monitor HDInsight clusters. Clamscanis the antivirus software that runs on the HDInsight cluster and is used by Azure security (azsecd) to protect your clusters from virus attacks. Microsoft strongly recommends that users refrain from making any changes to the defaultClamscanconfiguration. This process doesn't interfere with or take any cycles away from other processes. It will always yield to other process. CPU spikes fromClamscanshould be seen only when the system is idle. In scenarios in which you must control the schedule, you can use the following steps: Disable automatic execution using the following command: sudousr/local/bin/azsecd config -s clamav -d Disabledsudo service azsecd restart Add a Cron job that runs the following command as root: /usr/local/bin/azsecd manual -s clamav For more information about how to set up and run a cron job, seeHow do I set up a Cron job? LLAP is enabled for security reasons (Apache Ranger), not performance. Use larger node VMs to accommodate for the resource usage of LLAP (for example, minimum D13V2). There are two ways to achieve this goal:
1- You can recreate the cluster and add the additional group at the time of cluster creation. If you're using scoped synchronization in Microsoft Entra Domain Services, make sure group B is included in the scoped synchronization.
2- Add the group as a nested sub group of the previous group that was used to create the ESP cluster. For example, if you've created an ESP cluster with groupA, you can later on add groupBas a nested subgroup ofAand after approximately one hour it will be synced and available in the cluster automatically. No, it's currently not possible to add an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 storage account to a cluster that has blob storage as its primary storage. For more information, seeCompare storage options. You can find your settings inData Lake Storage Gen1 accessunder your cluster properties in the Azure portal. For more information, seeVerify cluster setup. Do one of the following actions: Use PowerShell Find the size of the/user/hive/.Trash/folder on the HDInsight cluster, using the following command line: hdfs dfs -du -h /user/hive/.Trash/ To audit blob storage accounts, configure monitoring using the procedure atMonitor a storage account in the Azure portal. An HDFS-audit log provides only auditing information for the local HDFS filesystem only (hdfs://mycluster).  It doesn't include operations that are done on remote storage. Run a script similar to the following shell script on your head node: Note The filefilenames.txtwill have the absolute path of the files in the blob containers. Currently, no Ranger plugin exists for blob storage and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 or Gen2. For ESP clusters, you should use Azure Data Lake Storage. You can at least set fine-grain permissions manually at the file system level using HDFS tools. Also, when using Azure Data Lake Storage, ESP clusters will do some of the file system access control using Microsoft Entra ID at the cluster level. You can assign data access policies to your users' security groups by using the Azure Storage Explorer. For more information, see: No. You can't increase the disk size of any worker node. So the only way to increase disk size is to drop the cluster and recreate it with larger worker VMs. Don't use HDFS for storing any of your HDInsight data, because the data is deleted if you delete your cluster. Instead, store your data in Azure. Scaling up the cluster can also add additional capacity to your HDInsight cluster. SeeUse empty edge nodes on Apache Hadoop clusters in HDInsight. After you create an edge node, you can connect to it by using SSH on port 22. You can find the name of the edge node from the cluster portal. The names usually end with-ed. You use persisted scripts to customize new worker nodes added to the cluster through scaling operations. Persisted scripts don't apply to edge nodes. You can use the following REST endpoints to pull the necessary information in JSON format. Use basic authentication headers to make the requests. To negotiate proper authentication tokens with your Microsoft Entra user, go through the gateway by using the following format: If you call the Curl command in the same virtual network or a peered virtual network, the command is: If you call the command from outside the virtual network or from a non-peered virtual network, the command format is: For a non-ESP cluster: For an ESP cluster: Note Curl prompts you for a password. You must enter a valid password for the cluster sign-in username. For more information about pricing and FAQ related to billing, see theAzure HDInsight Pricingpage. HDInsight cluster billing starts once a cluster is created and stops when the cluster is deleted. Billing is pro-rated per minute. For information about how to cancel your subscription, seeCancel your Azure subscription. For information about your subscription after it's canceled, seeWhat happens after I cancel my subscription? Although only 1.2 appears in the Ambari UI, HDInsight 3.6 contains both Hive 1.2 and Hive 2.1. For information about integration capabilities of stream processing, seeChoosing a stream processing technology in Azure. You can't do this action with HDInsight clusters. You can use Azure Data Factory for these scenarios. For compliance information, see theMicrosoft Trust Center.

"How do I include, manage, and install libraries?","You can install external packages via a requirements.txt file while creating the Spark pool, from the synapse workspace, or from the Azure portal. SeeManage libraries for Apache Spark in Azure Synapse Analytics.","A PowerShell module is a reusable package containing some PowerShell functionality.
Everything in PowerShell (functions, variables, DSC resources, etc.) can be packaged in
modules. Typically, modules are folders containing specific types of files stored on a
specific path. There are a few different types of PowerShell modules out there. A PowerShell script is a series of commands that are stored in a .ps1 file to enable reuse
and sharing. PowerShell workflows are also PowerShell scripts, which outline a set of
tasks and provide sequencing for those tasks. For more information, please visitGetting Started with PowerShell Workflow. Modules are generally better for sharing, but we are enabling script sharing to make it
easier for you to contribute workflows and scripts to the community. For more information,
see the following blogs: You must register an account in the PowerShell Gallery before you can publish packages to
the Gallery. This is because publishing packages requires a NuGetApiKey, which is provided
upon registration. To register, use your personal, work, or school account to sign in to
the PowerShell Gallery. A one-time registration process is required when you sign in for
the first time. Afterwards, your NuGetApiKey is available on your profile page. Once you have registered in the Gallery, use thePublish-ModuleorPublish-Scriptcmdlets to publish your package to the
Gallery. For more details on how to run these cmdlets, visit the Publish tab, or read thePublish-ModuleandPublish-Scriptdocumentation. You do not need to register or sign in to the Gallery to install or save packages. The full error message is: ""Failed to process request."" 'The specified API key is invalid
or does not have permission to access the specified package.'. The remote server returned
an error: (403) Forbidden."" This error can occur for the following reasons: Please be aware that your gallery account does not accommodate changes to your primary
email alias. For more information, seeMicrosoft Email Aliases. By selecting a Category checkbox, you are stating ""I would like to see all packages in
this category."" Only the packages in the selected categories will be displayed. So
similarly, by selecting all the Category checkboxes, you are stating ""I would like to see
all packages in any category."" But some packages in the gallery do not belong to any of
the categories listed, so they will not appear in the results. To see all packages in the
gallery, uncheck all the Categories, or select the packages tab again. Any kind of PowerShell module (script modules, binary modules, or manifest modules) can be
published to the gallery. To publish a module, PowerShellGet needs to know a few things
about it - the version, description, author, and how it is licensed. This information is
read as part of the publishing process from themodule manifest(.psd1) file, or from
the value of thePublish-Modulecmdlet'sLicenseUriparameter. All modules published to the Gallery must have module manifests.
Any module that includes the following information in its manifest can be published to the
Gallery: The easiest way to create a module manifest is to run theNew-ModuleManifestcmdlet. In
PowerShell 5.0 or newer, New-ModuleManifest generates a correctly-formatted module
manifest with blank fields for useful metadata likeProjectUri,LicenseUri, andTags. Simply fill in the blanks, or use the generated manifest as an example of
correct formatting. To verify that all required metadata fields have been properly filled, use theTest-ModuleManifestcmdlet. To update the module manifest file fields, use theUpdate-ModuleManifestcmdlet. Any kind of PowerShell script (scripts or workflows) can be published to the gallery. To
publish a script, PowerShellGet needs to know a few things about it - the version,
description, author, and how it is licensed. This information is read as part of the
publishing process from the script file'sPSScriptInfosection, or from the value of thePublish-Scriptcmdlet'sLicenseUriparameter. All
scripts published to the Gallery must have metadata information. Any script that includes
the following information in its PSScriptInfo section can be published to the Gallery: Type what you are looking for in the text box. For example, if you want to find modules
that are related to Azure SQL, just type ""azure sql"". Our search engine will look for
those keywords in all published packages, including titles, descriptions and across
metadata. Then, based on a weighted quality score, it will display the closest matches.
You can also search by specific field using field:""value"" syntax in the search query for
the following fields: So, for example, when you search for PowerShellVersion:""2.0"" only results that are
compatible with PowerShellVersion 2.0 (based on their module/script manifest) will be
displayed. The easiest way to create a properly-formatted script file is to run theNew-ScriptFileInfocmdlet. In PowerShell 5.0,
New-ScriptFileInfo generates a correctly-formatted script file with blank fields for
useful metadata likeProjectUri,LicenseUri, andTags. Simply fill in the
blanks, or use the generated script file as an example of correct formatting. To verify that all required metadata fields have been properly filled, use theTest-ScriptFileInfocmdlet. To update the script metadata fields, use theUpdate-ScriptFileInfocmdlet. The term PowerShell module also refers to the files that implement actual functionality.
Script module files (.psm1) contain PowerShell code. Binary module files (.dll) contain
compiled code. Here is one way to think about it: the folder that encapsulates the module is the module
folder. The module folder can contain a module manifest (.psd1) that describes the
contents of the folder. The files that actually do the work are the script module files
(.psm1) and the binary module files (.dll). DSC resources are located in a specific
sub-folder, and are implemented as script module files or binary module files. All of the modules in the Gallery contain module manifests, and most of these modules
contain script module files or binary module files. The term module can be confusing
because of these different meanings. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, all uses of the
word module on this page refer to the module folder containing these files. PackageManagement is a common interface for working with any package manager. Eventually,
whether you're dealing with PowerShell modules, MSIs, Ruby gems, NuGet packages, or Perl
modules, you should be able to use PackageManagement's commands (Find-Package and
Install-Package) to find and install them. PackageManagement does this by having a package
provider for each package manager that plugs into PackageManagement. Providers do all of
the actual work; they fetch content from repositories, and install the content locally.
Often, package providers simply wrap around the existing package manager tools for a given
package type. PowerShellGet is the package manager for PowerShell packages. There is a PSModule package
provider that exposes PowerShellGet functionality through PackageManagement. Because of
this, you can either runInstall-ModuleorInstall-Package -Provider PSModuleto install a module from the PowerShell Gallery.
Certain PowerShellGet functionality, includingUpdate-ModuleandPublish-Module, cannot be accessed through
PackageManagement commands. In summary, PowerShellGet is solely focused on having a premium package management
experience for PowerShell content. PackageManagement is focused on exposing all package
management experiences through one general set of tools. If you find this answer
unsatisfying, there is a long answer at the bottom of this document, in theHow does
PackageManagement actually relate to PowerShellGet?section. For more information, please visit thePackageManagement project page. The PowerShell Gallery is a modified version of theNuGet Gallery. PowerShellGet uses NuGet provider to work with
NuGet based repositories like the PowerShell Gallery. You can use PowerShellGet against any valid NuGet repository or file share. You simply
need to add the repository by running theRegister-PSRepositorycmdlet. Yes. Under the hood, PowerShellGet heavily leverages PackageManagement infrastructure. At the PowerShell cmdlet layer,Install-Moduleis
actually a thin wrapper aroundInstall-Package -Provider PSModule. At the PackageManagement package provider layer, the PSModule package provider actually
calls into other PackageManagement package providers. For example, when you are working
with NuGet-based galleries (such as the PowerShell Gallery), the PSModule package provider
uses the NuGet Package Provider to work with the repository.  Figure 1: PowerShellGet Architecture In general we recommend picking the latest version of PowerShellGet module (note that it
requires .NET 4.5). ThePowerShellGetmodule requiresPowerShell 3.0 or newer. Therefore,PowerShellGetrequires one of the following operating systems: PowerShellGetalso requires .NET Framework 4.5 or above. For more information, seeInstall the .NET Framework for developers. It is not possible to squat package names. If you feel that an existing package has taken
the name which suits your package more, trycontacting the owner of the package.
If you didn't get response within a couple of weeks, you can contact support and the
PowerShell Gallery team will look in to it. Check outManaging Package Owners on PowerShellGallery.comfor details. We encourage the PowerShell community to work together to resolve any disputes that may
arise between package owners and the owners of other packages. We have crafted adispute resolution processthat we ask

To enable Azure Synapse workspace features for an existing dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW), refer toHow to enable a workspace for your dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW).","This article answers frequently asked questions and explains best practices for Azure Virtual Desktop. If you want to create host pools and other objects, you must be assigned the Contributor role on the subscription or resource group you're working with. You must be assigned the User Access Admin role on an application group to publish application groups to users or user groups. To restrict an admin to only manage user sessions, such as sending messages to users, signing out users, and so on, you can create custom roles. For example: Users must be in the same Microsoft Entra tenant as their assigned workspace, host pool, and app group. Having everything in the same tenant lets you assign users to proper role-based access control (RBAC) roles so they can access their resources. However, you can deploy virtual machines (VMs) in a different Microsoft Entra tenant if they're joined to either the same AD as the user or an AD that has a trust relationship with the user's AD. All service resources have a location associated with them. A host pool's location determines which geography the service metadata for the host pool is stored in. An application group can't exist without a host pool. If you add apps to a RemoteApp application group, you also need a session host to determine the start menu apps. For any application group action, you'll also need a related data access on the host pool. To make sure data isn't being transferred between multiple locations, the application group's location should be the same as the host pool's. Workspaces also must be in the same location as their application groups. Whenever the workspace updates, the related application group updates along with it. Like with application groups, the service requires that all workspaces are associated with application groups created in the same location. When you run a PowerShell cmdlet, you only see the resource name and location. For example: To see all of a resource's properties, add eitherformat-listorflto the end of the cmdlet. For example: To see specific properties, add the specific property names afterformat-listorfl. For example: Azure Virtual Desktop doesn't support Microsoft Entra guest user accounts. For example, let's say a group of guest users have Microsoft 365 E3 Per-user, Windows E3 Per-user, or WIN VDA licenses in their own company, but are guest users in a different company's Microsoft Entra ID. The other company would manage the guest users' user objects in both Microsoft Entra ID and Active Directory like local accounts. You can't use your own licenses for the benefit of a third-party. Also, Azure Virtual Desktop doesn't currently support Microsoft Account (MSA). We don't currently have a reliable way to collect the web client's IP addresses, so we don't include that value in the table. There are multiple options in Azure Virtual Desktop for handling backup. At the Compute level, backup is recommended only for Personal Host Pools throughAzure Backup. At the Storage level, recommended backup solution varies based on the backend storage used to store user profiles. If Azure Files Share is used,Azure Backup for File Shareis recommended. If Azure NetApp Files is used,Snaphots/PoliciesorAzure NetApp Files Backupare tools available. Azure Virtual Desktop is currently optimized for Teams. Microsoft currently doesn't support third-party collaboration apps like Zoom. Third-party organizations are responsible for giving compatibility guidelines to their customers. Azure Virtual Desktop also doesn't support Skype for Business. Once you create a host pool, you can't change its type. However, you can move any VMs you register to a host pool to a different type of host pool. These factors can affect scale limit for host pools: The Azure template is limited to 800 objects. To learn more, seeAzure subscription and service limits, quotas, and constraints. Each VM also creates about six objects, so that means you can create around 132 VMs each time you run the template. There are restrictions on how many vCPUs you can create per region and per subscription. For example, if you have an Enterprise Agreement subscription, by default you can create 350 vCPUs. You need to divide 350 by either the default number of vCPUs per VM or your own vCPU limit to determine how many VMs you can create each time you run the template. Learn more atVirtual Machines limits - Azure Resource ManagerandCheck vCPU quotas. The VM prefix name can't exceed 11 characters, so that when a sequential number is added the total name is a maximum of 15 characters. To learn more, seeNaming rules and restrictions for Azure resources. Azure Lighthouse doesn't fully support managing Azure Virtual Desktop environments. Since Lighthouse doesn't currently support cross-Microsoft Entra ID tenant user management, Lighthouse customers still need to sign in to the Microsoft Entra ID that customers use to manage users. You also can't use CSP sandbox subscriptions with the Azure Virtual Desktop service. To learn more, seeIntegration sandbox account. Finally, if you enabled the resource provider from the CSP owner account, the CSP customer accounts aren't able to modify the resource provider. After you register a VM to a host pool within the Azure Virtual Desktop service, the agent regularly refreshes the VM's token whenever the VM is active. The certificate for the registration token is valid for 90 days. Because of this 90-day limit, we recommend VMs to be online for 20 minutes every 90 days so that the machine can refresh its tokens and update the agent and side-by-side stack components. Turning on your VM within this time limit prevents its registration token from expiring or becoming invalid. If you started your VM after 90 days and are experiencing registration issues, follow the instructions in theAzure Virtual Desktop agent troubleshooting guideto remove the VM from the host pool, reinstall the agent, and reregister it to the pool. Yes. Azure Virtual Desktop host pools have an option for selecting either availability set or availability zones when you create a VM. These availability options are the same as the ones Azure Compute uses. If you select a zone for the VM you create in a host pool, the setting automatically applies to all VMs you create in that zone. If you'd prefer to spread your host pool VMs across multiple zones, you need to follow the directions inAdd virtual machines with the Azure portalto manually select a new zone for each new VM you create. Make sure thatAzure availability zonesare available in the region where your VMs are located. The availability option you should use for your VMs depends on your image's location. The following table explains the relationship each setting has with these variables to help you figure out which option is best for your deployment. We recommend you use Windows Defender Application Control instead of AppLocker. Yes. You can have both deployments within the same Microsoft Entra tenant. No.Ephemeral OS disks for Azure VMsaren't supported with Azure Virtual Desktop. Metadata of a host pool is replicated within a geography for resiliency. If the region your host pool is in goes down, it fails over to its replica. During this failover period, Azure Virtual Desktop doesn't accept new user connections to the session host VMs in that host pool until the failover is complete. Any existing sessions on the session host VMs in that host pool remain connected and unaffected. To learn more about how service resilience is implemented for Azure Virtual Desktop, seeAzure Virtual Desktop service architecture and resilience. If you try to go over 200 VMs in an availability set in Azure Virtual Desktop, you receive an error message that says ""Can't create VM because the limit of 200 VMs has already been reached."" For more information, see theAvailability sets overview. Session hosts in a pooled host pool aren't supported for in-place upgrade. Session hosts in a personal host pool are supported for in-place upgrade. For more information, seeIn-place upgrade for supported VMs running Windows in AzureandIn-place upgrade for VMs running Windows Server in Azure.

"Now that Azure Synapse is GA, how do I move my dedicated SQL pools that were previously standalone into Azure Synapse?","There is no â€œmoveâ€ or â€œmigrationâ€ necessary. You can choose to enable new workspace features on your existing pools. If you do, there are no breaking changes, instead you'll be able to use new features such as Synapse Studio, Spark, and serverless SQL pools. Not all features of the dedicated SQL pool in Azure Synapse workspaces apply to dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW), and vice versa. To enable workspace features for an existing dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW) refer toHow to enable a workspace for your dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW).","APPLIES TO:NoSQL First you must sign up for an Azure subscription. Once you sign up for an Azure subscription, you can add an API for NoSQL container to your Azure subscription. Software development kits (SDKs)are available for .NET, Python, Node.js, JavaScript, Go, and Java. Developers can also use theREST APIto interact with Azure Cosmos DB resources from more platforms and languages. Check out these QuickStart code samples and templates for the API for NoSQL: Yes, the API for NoSQL allows applications to store arbitrary JSON documents as items without schema definitions or hints. The data is immediately available for query with the Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL query language. Yes, the API for NoSQL supports cross-document transactions expressed using either batches in the SDKs or as JavaScript-stored procedures and triggers. Transactions are scoped to a single partition within each container and executed with ACID semantics as ""all or nothing,"" isolated from other concurrently executing code and user requests. If exceptions occur, the entire transaction is rolled back. You can create databases by using one of these tools: Yes! Azure Cosmos DB supports Microsoft Entra authentication to manage the service and its resources (control-plane) and to execute data, operations, and queries (data-plane).
Control-plane authentication is performed using therole-based access controlfeature of Azure. You can use a preconfigured built-in role](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md) or you cancreate a custom role. With Azure role-based access control, you can manage accounts, databases, containers, and metadata. The control-plane includes operations including, but not limited to these examples. Structured Query Language (SQL) is a language typically used to query relational data. The API for NoSQL has a customNoSQLquery language derived from SQL. The NoSQL query language includes a subset of the SQL query language typically associated with SQL Server along with various NoSQL-specific enhancements. The NoSQL query language provides rich hierarchical and relational operators and extensibility via JavaScript-based, user-defined functions (UDFs). JSON grammar allows for modeling JSON documents as trees with labeled nodes, which are used by both the Azure Cosmos DB automatic indexing techniques and the SQL query dialect of Azure Cosmos DB. For information about using this query language, seeNoSQL Query. The API for NoSQL supports aggregation via aggregate functions such as:COUNT,MAX,AVG, andSUMvia the NoSQL query language. The API for NoSQL supports optimistic concurrency control (OCC) through HTTP entity tags, orETags. Every API for NoSQL resource has an ETag, and the ETag is set on the server every time a document is updated. The ETag header and the current value are included in all response messages. ETags can be used with theIf-Matchheader to allow the server to decide whether a resource should be updated. The If-Match value is the ETag value to be checked against. If the ETag value matches the server ETag value, the resource is updated. If the ETag is no longer current, the server rejects the operation with an ""HTTP 412 Precondition failure"" response code. The client then refetches the resource to acquire the current ETag value for the resource. In addition, ETags can be used with theIf-None-Matchheader to determine whether its needed to refetch a resource. Most of the API for NoSQL SDKs includes classes to manage optimistic concurrency control. Use the bulk import feature in the.NET SDKor theJava SDKfor the API for NoSQL to import large sets of data. This feature optimizes provisioned throughput to import large sets of data. Alternatively, useApache Sparkto import data at scale using Python or Scala. Yes, because Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL is a RESTful service, resource links are immutable and can be cached. API for NoSQL clients can specify an ""If-None-Match"" header for reads against any resource-like document or container and then update their local copies after the server version changes. Yes. TheAzure Cosmos DB emulatorprovides a high-fidelity emulation of the Azure Cosmos DB service. It supports functionality that's identical to Azure Cosmos DB across various APIs. This functionality includes support for creating items, querying items, provisioning containers, and scaling containers. You can develop and test applications by using the emulator's endpoints. You can then deploy the applications to Azure at a global scale by changing the connection string from the emulator to the live service. This Data Explorer limitation is a limitation of JavaScript. JavaScript uses double-precision floating-point format numbers as specified in Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 754. This data type can safely hold numbers between -(253- 1) and 253-1 (that is, 9007199254740991) only. Role-based access control (RBAC) is a method of regulating access to computer or network resources based on the roles of individual users within an enterprise. In Azure Cosmos DB, RBAC is used to grant data-plane access to users and applications. For more information about various terms in role-based access control, see thesecurity glossary. Use the Azure Cosmos DB native role-based access control (RBAC) feature to grant data-plane access to users and applications. For more information, seeGrant data-plane role-based access.

What is the default deployment of dedicated SQL pools now?,"By Default, all new dedicated SQL pools will be deployed to a workspace; however, if you need to you can still create a dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW) in a standalone form factor.","Important Cloud Services (classic) is now deprecated for all customers as of September 1st, 2024. Any existing running deployments will be stopped and shut down by Microsoft and the data will be permanently lost starting October 2024. New deployments should use the new Azure Resource Manager based deployment modelAzure Cloud Services (extended support). This article includes frequently asked questions about deployment issues forMicrosoft Azure Cloud Services. You can also consult theCloud Services Virtual Machine (VM) Size pagefor size information. If your Azure issue is not addressed in this article, visit the Azure forums onMicrosoft Q & A and Stack Overflow. You can post your issue in these forums, or post to@AzureSupport on Twitter. You also can submit an Azure support request. To submit a support request, on theAzure supportpage, selectGet support. If a cloud service has a deployment in either slot, the entire cloud service is pinned to a specific cluster. This means that if a deployment already exists in the production slot, a new staging deployment can only be allocated in the same cluster as the production slot. Allocation failures occur when the cluster where your cloud service is located doesn't have enough physical compute resources to satisfy your deployment request. For help with mitigating such allocation failures, seeCloud Service allocation failure: Solutions. When a cloud service is deployed, it usually gets pinned to a specific cluster. This means scaling up/out an existing cloud service must allocate new instances in the same cluster. If the cluster is nearing capacity or the desired VM size/type isn't available, the request may fail. For help with mitigating such allocation failures, seeCloud Service allocation failure: Solutions. The fabric in any cluster in that region can allocate a new deployment to an empty cloud service, unless the cloud service is pinned to an affinity group. Attempted deployments to the same affinity group occur on the same cluster. If the cluster is nearing capacity, the request may fail. For help with mitigating such allocation failures, seeCloud Service allocation failure: Solutions. The clusters in a datacenter may have different configurations of machine types (for example, A series, Av2 series, D series, Dv2 series, G series, H series, etc.), but not all the clusters would necessarily have all the kinds of VMs. For example, if you try to add a D series VM to a cloud service that is already deployed in an A series-only cluster, you experience an allocation failure. This failure also happens if you try to change VM SKU sizes (for example, switching from an A series to a D series). For help with mitigating such allocation failures, seeCloud Service allocation failure: Solutions. To check the sizes available in your region, seeMicrosoft Azure: Products available by region. Deployment of a cloud service may fail if the resources that are required to be allocated exceed the default or maximum quota allowed for your service at the region/datacenter level. For more information, seeCloud Services limits. You could also track the current usage/quota for your subscription at the portal: Azure portalâ€¯=> Subscriptionsâ€¯=> <appropriate subscription>â€¯=> ""Usage + quota"". Resource usage/consumption-related information can also be retrieved via the Azure Billing APIs. SeeAzure consumption API overview. You can't change the VM size of a deployed cloud service without redeploying it. The VM size is built into the CSDEF, which can only be updated with a redeployment. For more information, seeHow to update a cloud service. Since the Cloud Service is a Classic resource that isn't directly compatible with the Azure Resource Manager model, you can't associate it with the Azure Resource Manager Storage accounts. Here are few options: Deploying through REST API. When you deploy through the classic deployment model, you could get around the limitation by specifying a SAS URL to the blob storage, which works with both Classic and Azure Resource Manager Storage account. Read more about the 'PackageUrl' propertyhere. Deploying throughAzure portal. This solution works from theAzure portalas the call goes through a proxy/shim that allows communication between Azure Resource Manager and Classic resources. In the classic portal, the package was uploaded to the management API layer directly, and then the API layer would temporarily put the package into an internal storage account. This process causes performance and scalability problems because the API layer wasn't designed to be a file upload service. In the Azure portal (Resource Manager deployment model), we bypassed the interim step of first uploading to the API layer, resulting in faster and more reliable deployments. As for the cost, it's small and you can reuse the same storage account across all deployments. You can use thestorage cost calculatorto determine the cost to upload the service package (CSPKG), download the CSPKG, then delete the CSPKG. Deployment issues for Azure Cloud Services (classic): Frequently asked questions (FAQs) In this article Why does deploying a cloud service to the staging slot sometimes fail with a resource allocation error if there's already an existing deployment in the production slot?

If you don't see the answer to your question, you can contact us through the following channels (in escalating order): The comments section of this article. Azure Front Door Feedback. Microsoft Support:To create a new support request, in the Azure portal, on theHelptab, select theHelp + supportbutton, and then selectNew support request. Azure Front Door is a cloud-based service that delivers your applications faster and more reliably. It uses layer 7 load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple regions and endpoints. It also offers dynamic site acceleration (DSA) to optimize web performance and near real-time failover to ensure high availability. Azure Front Door is a fully managed service, so you don't have to worry about scaling or maintenance. Azure Front Door is a service that offers many benefits for your web applications, such as dynamic site acceleration (DSA), which improves the performance and user experience of your sites. Azure Front Door also handles TLS/SSL offloading and end to end TLS, which enhances the security and encryption of your web traffic. Additionally, Azure Front Door provides Web Application Firewall, cookie-based session affinity, url path-based routing, free certificates and multiple domain managements, and more. To learn more about the features and capabilities of Azure Front Door, seetier comparison. Azure Front Door and Azure Application Gateway are both load balancers for HTTP/HTTPS traffic, but they have different scopes. Front Door is a global service that can distribute requests across regions, while Application Gateway is a regional service that can balance requests within a region. Azure Front Door works with scale units, clusters or stamp units, while Azure Application Gateway works with VMs, containers or other resources in the same scale unit. Application Gateway behind Front Door is useful in these situations: Chaining two CDNs is generally not a recommended approach, it would work but comes with the following cons To use Azure Front Door, you must have a public VIP or a DNS name that is publicly accessible. Azure Front Door uses the public IP to route the traffic to your origin. A common scenario is to deploy an Azure Load Balancer behind Front Door. You can also use Private Link with Azure Front Door Premium to connect to an internal load balancer. For more information, seeenable Private Link with internal load balancer. Azure Front Door supports HTTP, HTTPS and HTTP/2. Azure Front Door supports HTTP/2 protocol for client connections. However, the backend pool communication uses HTTP/1.1 protocol. HTTP/2 support is on by default. You can use different types of origins for Azure Front Door, such as: The origin must have a public IP or a DNS hostname that can be resolved publicly. You can mix and match backends from different zones, regions, or even outside of Azure, as long as they're publicly accessible. Azure Front Door isn't limited to any Azure region, but operates globally. The only location you have to choose when you create a Front Door is the location of the resource group, which determines where the resource group's metadata get stored. The Front Door profile is a global resource and its configuration is distributed to all edge locations worldwide. For the complete list of points of presence (POPs) that provide global load balancing and content delivery for Azure Front Door, seeAzure Front Door POP locations. This list is updated regularly as new POPs are added or removed. You can also use the Azure Resource Manager API to query the current list of POPs programmatically. Azure Front Door is a service that distributes your application globally across multiple regions. It uses a common infrastructure that gets shared by all its customers, but you can customize your own Front Door profile to configure your application's specific requirements. Other customers' configurations can't affect your Front Door configuration, which is isolated from theirs. You can redirect host, path, and query string components of a URL with Azure Front Door. To learn how to configure URL redirection, refer toURL redirection. Front Door doesn't sort the routes for your web application. Instead, it chooses the route that best fits the request. To find out how Front Door matches requests to routes, seeHow Front Door matches requests to a routing rule. To ensure optimal performance of Front Door's features, you should only allow traffic that comes from Azure Front Door to reach your origin. As a result, unauthorized or malicious requests encounter the security and routing policies of Front Door and are denied access. To learn how to secure your origin, seeSecure traffic to Azure Front Door origins. The IP address of your Front Door's frontend anycast is fixed and might not change as long as you use the Front Door. However, the fixed IP address of your Front Door's frontend anycast isn't a guarantee. Avoid relying on the IP directly. Azure Front Door is a dynamic service that routes traffic to the best available backend. It doesn't offer static or dedicated frontend anycast IPs at this time. Yes. Refer to the MatchedRulesSetName property underAccess Logs. Yes. For more information, seeMicrosoft response to DDoS attacks against HTTP/2. Azure Front Door supports the X-Forwarded-For, X-Forwarded-Host, and X-Forwarded-Proto headers. These headers help Front Door identify the original client IP and protocol. If X-Forwarded-For is already present, Front Door adds the client socket IP to the end of the list. Otherwise, it creates the header with the client socket IP as the value. For X-Forwarded-Host and X-Forwarded-Proto, Front Door replaces the existing values with its own. For more information, seeFront Door supported HTTP headers. The deployment time for new Front Door configurations varies depending on the type of change. Typically, it takes between 3 and 20 minutes for the changes to propagate to all our edge locations worldwide. Note Custom TLS/SSL certificate updates might take longer, from several minutes up to an hour, to be deployed globally. Updates to routes or origin groups/backend pools are seamless and don't cause any downtime (assuming the new configuration is correct). Certificate updates are also done atomically, so there's no risk of outage. No. Currently, Azure Front Door only supports HTTP/1.1 from the edge to the origin. For gRPC to work, HTTP/2 is required. To use Azure Front Door Standard, Premium or (classic) tier, you need a public IP or a DNS name that can be resolved publicly. This requirement of a public IP or a DNS name that can be resolved publicly allows Azure Front Door to route traffic to your backend resources. You can use Azure resources like Application Gateways or Azure Load Balancers to route traffic to resources in a virtual network. If you use Front Door Premium tier, you can use Private Link to connect to origins behind an internal load balancer with a private endpoint. For more information, seeSecure origins with Private Link. An origin group is a collection of origins that can handle similar types of requests. You need a different origin group for each application or workload that is different. In an origin group, you create an origin for every server or service that can serve requests. If your origin has a load balancer, like Azure Application Gateway, or is hosted on a PaaS that has a load balancer, then the origin group only has one origin. Your origin takes care of failover and load balancing between origins that Front Door doesn't see. For example, if you host an application on Azure App Service, how you set up Front Door depends on how many application instances you have: To learn more, seeOrigins and origin groups in Azure Front Door. Azure Front Door is a service that provides fast and reliable web delivery for your applications. It offers features such as caching, load balancing, security, and routing. However, you need to be aware of some timeouts and limits that apply to Azure Front Door. These timeouts and limits include the maximum request size, the maximum response size, the maximum header size, the maximum number of headers, the maximum number of rules, and the maximum number of origin groups. You can find the detailed information about these timeouts and limits in theAzure Front Door documentation. The configuration updates for most rule sets are done in less than 20 minutes. The rule will be applied right after the update is finished. Azure Front Door and Azure CDN are two services that provide fast and reliable web delivery for your applications. However, they aren't compatible with each other, because they share the same network of Azure edge sites to deliver content to your users. This shared network causes conflicts between their routing and caching policies. Therefore, you have to choose either Azure Front Door or Azure CDN for your application, depending on your performance and security requirements. The fact that both profiles would use the same Azure edge sites to handle incoming requests causes this limitation that prevents you from nesting one Azure Front Door profile behind another. This setup would cause routing conflicts and performance issues. Therefore, you should ensure that your Azure Front Door profiles are independent and not chained together, if you need to use multiple profiles for your applications. Azure Front Door uses three service tags to manage the traffic between your clients and your origins: For more information on Azure Front Door service tags scenarios, seeavailable service tags. Azure Front Door has a 5-second timeout for receiving headers from client. The connection is terminated if the client doesn't send headers within 5 seconds to Azure Front Door after establishing TCP/TLS connection. You can't configure this timeout value. Azure Front Door has a 90-second HTTP keep-alive timeout. The connection is terminated if the client doesn't send data for 90 seconds, which is the HTTP keep-alive timeout for Azure Front Door. You can't configure this timeout value. You can't use the same domains for more than one Front Door endpoint, because Front Door needs to distinguish the route (protocol + host + path combination) for each request. If you have duplicate routes across different endpoints, Azure Front Door can't process the requests correctly. At this time, we don't offer the option to move domains from one endpoint to another without any interruption in service. You need to plan for some downtime if you want to migrate your domains to a different endpoint. Azure Front Door Private Link feature is region agnostic and will work even if you choose a region that is different from the region where your origin is located. In such cases, to ensure lower latency, you should always pick an Azure region closest to your origin when choosing to enable Azure Front Door Private Link endpoint. We are in the process of enabling support for more regions. Once a new region is supported, you can follow theseinstructionsto gradually shift traffic to the new region. Azure Front Door is a platform that distributes traffic across the world and can scale up to meet your application's demands. It uses Microsoft's global network edge to deliver global load-balancing capability that lets you switch your entire application or specific microservices to different regions or clouds if there was failure. To avoid errors when delivering large files, make sure your origin server includes theContent-Rangeheader in the response, and that the header value matches the actual size of the response body. You can find more details on how to configure your origin and Front Door for large file delivery inDelivery of large files. Domain fronting is a network technique that enables an attacker to conceal the actual destination of a malicious request by using a different domain name in the TLS handshake and the HTTP host header. Azure Front Door (Standard, Premium and Classic tier) or Azure CDN Standard from Microsoft (classic) resources created after November 8, 2022, have domain fronting blocking enabled. Rather than blocking a request with mismatched SNI and host headers, we permit the discrepancy if the two domains belong to the same subscription and are included in the routes/routing rules. Domain fronting blocking enforcement will start on January 22, 2024, for all existing domains. The enforcement may require up to two weeks to propagate to all regions. When Front Door blocks a request due to a mismatch: For more information about domain fronting, seeSecuring our approach to domain fronting within AzureandProhibiting domain fronting on Azure Front Door and Azure CDN Standard from Microsoft (classic). Front Door uses TLS 1.2 as the minimum version for all profiles created after September 2019. You can choose to use TLS 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 or 1.3 with Azure Front Door. To learn more, read theAzure Front Door end-to-end TLSarticle. Azure Front Door is a service that provides fast and secure web delivery. It allows you to define how your web traffic is routed and optimized across multiple regions and endpoints. Azure Front Door resources, such as Front Door profiles and routing rules, are only charged when they're enabled. However, web application firewall (WAF) policies and rules are charged regardless of their status. Even if you disable a WAF policy or rule, it still incurs costs for you. No. No. AFD does not support dynamic compression for content greater than 8 MB. However, if the content has been already compressed by the origin, Front Door supports serving static compressed content over 8 MB as long as range request is supported and chunked transfer encoding is not enabled. No. For information on logs and other diagnostic capabilities, seeMonitoring metrics and logs for Front Door. You can store diagnostic logs in their own storage account and choose how long to keep them. Alternatively, diagnostic logs can be sent to Event Hubs or Azure Monitor logs. For more information, seeAzure Front Door diagnostics. To access the audit logs of Azure Front Door, you need to visit the portal. Select your Front Door from the menu page and select onActivity Log. The Activity Log provides you with the records of your Azure Front Doorâ€™s operations. You can set up alerts for Azure Front Door based onmetrics or logs. By doing so, you can monitor the performance and health of your front-end hosts. To learn how to create alerts for Azure Front Door Standard and Premium, seeconfigure alerts.

How does pricing work?,"DDoS protection plans have a fixed monthly charge that covers up to 100 public IP addresses. Protection for additional resources is available. 
 Under a tenant, a single DDoS protection plan can be used across multiple subscriptions, so there's no need to create more than one DDoS protection plan. 
 When Application Gateway with WAF is deployed in a DDoS protected VNet, there are no extra charges for WAF - you pay for the Application Gateway at the  lower non-WAF rate . This policy applies to both Application Gateway v1 and v2 SKUs. 
 See  Azure DDoS Protection pricing  for pricing and more details.","This article addresses frequently asked questions about private offers from independent software vendors (ISVs) to customers in Partner Center. Private offers let you transact private deals with your customers in the commercial marketplace. This new feature supports many new capabilities and addresses limitations associated with private plans. You can use it to:  * Requires a publicly transactable offer in the marketplace. You can create private offers for all transactable offer types: SaaS, Azure VM, Azure container and Azure application. Private offers aren't currently available in Microsoft AppSource. On thePrivate offersdashboard, you can: To offer your employees free access to your products by using the marketplace: After you finish these steps, Microsoft charges only the infrastructure cost for any usage or subscription on that billing account. To create a private offer, you need the billing account ID of your customer. Billing account information is available only to customers. Publishers can't access it. Customers can find the billing account information in the Azure portal by going toCost Management + Billing>Settings>Properties. Or, if a customer knows the subscription that they plan to use for the purchase, they can find their billing account information in the Azure portal by selectingSubscriptions, selecting the relevant subscription, and then going toProperties(orBilling Properties). To access this information, the customer must be an owner or contributor on the billing account. If a customer doesn't have a billing account, they can create one by signing up on Azure.com. SeeBilling account scopes in the Azure portal. With the private offer applied at the level of the billing account ID, if new subscriptions are added to the customer's Azure plan, the private offer automatically applies to those subscriptions. You don't need to make edits to the private offer. While you're creating a new private offer, selectAccepted dateas the start date to make the price available for the customer to transact as soon as the private offer is accepted. ChooseSpecific monthto make the private price available in a future calendar month. For example: If you create a private offer on May 15 and want the private price to be available to the customer on June 1, selectJune. The private offer starts on the first day of the month and ends on the last day. You can't select specific start and end dates. If the customer purchases the public offer or plan before June 1, they won't receive the private offer price for any transactions before June 1. The time zone for the start date is Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Note If a private offer is extended to an existing customer of pay-as-you-go consumption-based products like virtual machines, selectingAccepted datemakes the private price applicable for the entire month. For example: If you create a private offer on May 15 for a virtual machine product and selectAccepted date, the private price will apply for the entire month of acceptance. TheAccept bydate is the private offer's expiration date. Your customer must accept the private offer before the end of this date or the private offer expires.End datespecifies the date on which the private price and terms end. The time zone for the accept-by date and the end date is UTC. You can document and upload custom terms and conditions that you and the customer agreed upon as part of the private deal. The customer is required to legally accept these terms and conditions as part of accepting the private offer. Uploading custom terms and conditions is optional in a private offer. You can upload only one document, and it must be in PDF format. Custom terms and conditions between you and the customer shouldn't violate any terms in the Microsoft Publisher Agreement. It depends. If you want to use the public terms of use for the private offer with no changes, you can skip uploading any custom terms and conditions to the private offer. Public terms of use are presented to the customer during purchase of the private offer. If you want to amend the public terms for the private offer, you need to upload custom terms and conditions to the private offer. Custom terms and conditions are presented to the customer during purchase of the private offer. You can use a discounted price to provide a percentage-based discount on top of a publicly listed plan. You can specify a discounted price only when the private price is lower than the publicly listed plan price. You can use an absolute price to specify a price point that's higher, lower, or equal to the publicly listed plan price. You can apply an absolute price only at a plan level. You can't apply an absolute price for VM offer types or any plans that have a trial enabled. The clone option creates an editable copy of an existing private offer that you can publish as a new private offer. You can use cloning on any private offer, regardless of its status. You can upgrade an existing private offer that a customer accepted. The marketplace supports upgrades only at renewal. For example, the upgraded offer's start and end date can't overlap with the existing private offer. You can edit only pricing, dates, terms, and notification contacts for the upgraded private offer. If you need other changes, create a new private offer. You can't change a private offer in aPending Acceptancestate. If the customer hasn't accepted the private offer, you can withdraw the offer from the customer to make changes. After you withdraw a private offer, your customer can't access it unless you resubmit it to the customer. Private offers created undercustomize pricing for existing public offers and plansmust be unique and not overlap with another customer private offer or multiparty private offer for the same customer billing account ID, using the same base public plan, with overlapping private offer start and end dates. Overlapping private offers are blocked at submission in Partner Center. To remedy this conflict, you have several options depending on whether the customer has already accepted the private offer.  Note For private offers published before 2025 with the same customer billing account ID, same product plan(s), and overlapping private offer start and end dates, the price is determined as follows: Partner Center uses theNotification Contactsinformation to notify you of changes to the private offer status. The notification email is sent when the private offer status changes fromIn ProgresstoPending Acceptance,Pending AcceptancetoAccepted, orPending AcceptancetoExpired. No, Microsoft doesn't send any notifications to the customer. You should copy the private offer link and send it to the customer for acceptance. No. You're notified via the SaaS fulfillment API that a SaaS offer is activated but not that it has an associated private offer. You can see if the customer accepted a private offer in theInsightsreporting. You can't upgrade a private offer during the offer's term. You can create an upgrade at any time and a customer could accept it, but the upgrade takes effect only at the end of the existing private offer. Use theUpgradefeature to extend the start and end date and to include revised custom terms and conditions associated with the private offer. To add or remove offers and plans, create a new private offer. Any user within the customer's organization can see the details of a private offer. To accept a private offer, the user in the customer organization needs to be an owner, contributor, or admin on the billing account. Without appropriate permissions, the user can't accept the private offer. To get access to the billing account, the user should contact the admin or owner. A red notice at the top of the page indicates three people in the customer's organization who have the appropriate permissions. After a private offer is accepted, it's a legal agreement between you and the customer, so it can't be changed. If the private offer is due to begin on the accepted date, the customer can go to the Azure portal to subscribe to the offer by using any Azure subscription associated with the billing account. The customer must use an Azure subscription associated with the configured billing account to get the private price. If the private offer includes pay-as-you-go offers (virtual machines) and was extended to an existing customer, the customer is charged at the private price as soon as the private offer is accepted. For a private offer that includes SaaS, the customer must subscribe to the SaaS product and then configure the product within 30 days of subscribing to it. If you configured the private offer to begin at a future date, your customer could accept the private offer before the accept-by date but should not complete the purchase until after the private offer's start date. After the customer accepts the private offer, it can take up to 15 minutes for the private price to appear in the marketplace on the product details page. If the customer transacts within these 15 minutes, the marketplace still charges the customer correctly by using the private price. Accepting a private offer doesn't initiate billing. To complete the purchase, customers must subscribe to the SaaS product or deploy the virtual machine or Azure application product within the private offer in the Azure portal. For a private offer that includes a SaaS product, the customer must also configure the product within 30 days of subscribing to it. If the customer chose automatic renewal, and you don't create a new private offer that the customer accepts, the customer is charged the list price of the public plan. Yes. Customers who have a Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment can decrement it for benefit-eligible purchases through customer private offers. Customers can't decrement their Azure Consumption Commitment for product purchases through CSP private offers. There are no changes in the payout experience for private offers. After a customer transacts by using private offers, the transaction details appear on theEarningspage in Partner Center. In theInsightsworkspace, you can filter theOrdersandUsagereports by private offers and public offers. You should use private offers for your negotiated deals on Azure Marketplace. Private plans continue to be supported and can be used for specific scenarios. For example, you can use a private plan if you want to use a private (custom) VM image for your customer as part of the private deal or if it meets requirements for their specific use case. To use private offers, ISVs must have publicly transactable plans published to Azure Marketplace. We don't recommend that you have both a private plan and a private offer for the same customer, product, and time period. Private plans can continue to exist for existing deals, and you can use private offers for new deals. Move customers to private offers as each customer's private plan term comes up for renewal or expiration. You can create a private offer that will begin at the end of the current subscription term for the private plan. After your customers accept the private offer, they need to subscribe to the plan that your private offer contains. You can also move your customers to private offers in the middle of a private plan term. If a customer paid for the full term of the original private plan, create a private offer and set the customer price to $0 or apply a 100% discount to your retail price. Your customer then needs to accept the private offer terms and subscribe to the products within the private offer. Private offers support monthly, annual, two-year, or three-year terms. If your customer has a remaining duration that's different from these terms, it's best for the customer to complete the private plan term before subscribing to a private offer. For example, if your customer is in year two of a three-year private plan term and is due to pay for a third year, you can create a private offer for a one-year duration to charge the customer's final year via a private offer. Your customer then needs to cancel the original subscription to the private plan to avoid being charged as part of renewing the private plan. You can then stop-sell the private plan.

Which Azure DDoS Protection tier should I choose?,"If you need to protect less than 15 public IP resources, the IP Protection tier is the more cost-effective option. If you have more than 15 public IP resources to protect, then the Network Protection tier is more cost-effective. Network Protection also offers additional features, including DDoS Protection Rapid Response (DRR), cost protection guarantees, and Web Application Firewall (WAF) discounts.","This article answers common questions about Azure Front Door features and functionality. If you don't see the answer to your question, you can contact us through the following channels (in escalating order): The comments section of this article. Azure Front Door Feedback. Microsoft Support:To create a new support request, in the Azure portal, on theHelptab, select theHelp + supportbutton, and then selectNew support request. Azure Front Door is a cloud-based service that delivers your applications faster and more reliably. It uses layer 7 load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple regions and endpoints. It also offers dynamic site acceleration (DSA) to optimize web performance and near real-time failover to ensure high availability. Azure Front Door is a fully managed service, so you don't have to worry about scaling or maintenance. Azure Front Door is a service that offers many benefits for your web applications, such as dynamic site acceleration (DSA), which improves the performance and user experience of your sites. Azure Front Door also handles TLS/SSL offloading and end to end TLS, which enhances the security and encryption of your web traffic. Additionally, Azure Front Door provides Web Application Firewall, cookie-based session affinity, url path-based routing, free certificates and multiple domain managements, and more. To learn more about the features and capabilities of Azure Front Door, seetier comparison. Azure Front Door and Azure Application Gateway are both load balancers for HTTP/HTTPS traffic, but they have different scopes. Front Door is a global service that can distribute requests across regions, while Application Gateway is a regional service that can balance requests within a region. Azure Front Door works with scale units, clusters or stamp units, while Azure Application Gateway works with VMs, containers or other resources in the same scale unit. Application Gateway behind Front Door is useful in these situations: Chaining two CDNs is generally not a recommended approach, it would work but comes with the following cons To use Azure Front Door, you must have a public VIP or a DNS name that is publicly accessible. Azure Front Door uses the public IP to route the traffic to your origin. A common scenario is to deploy an Azure Load Balancer behind Front Door. You can also use Private Link with Azure Front Door Premium to connect to an internal load balancer. For more information, seeenable Private Link with internal load balancer. Azure Front Door supports HTTP, HTTPS and HTTP/2. Azure Front Door supports HTTP/2 protocol for client connections. However, the backend pool communication uses HTTP/1.1 protocol. HTTP/2 support is on by default. You can use different types of origins for Azure Front Door, such as: The origin must have a public IP or a DNS hostname that can be resolved publicly. You can mix and match backends from different zones, regions, or even outside of Azure, as long as they're publicly accessible. Azure Front Door isn't limited to any Azure region, but operates globally. The only location you have to choose when you create a Front Door is the location of the resource group, which determines where the resource group's metadata get stored. The Front Door profile is a global resource and its configuration is distributed to all edge locations worldwide. For the complete list of points of presence (POPs) that provide global load balancing and content delivery for Azure Front Door, seeAzure Front Door POP locations. This list is updated regularly as new POPs are added or removed. You can also use the Azure Resource Manager API to query the current list of POPs programmatically. Azure Front Door is a service that distributes your application globally across multiple regions. It uses a common infrastructure that gets shared by all its customers, but you can customize your own Front Door profile to configure your application's specific requirements. Other customers' configurations can't affect your Front Door configuration, which is isolated from theirs. You can redirect host, path, and query string components of a URL with Azure Front Door. To learn how to configure URL redirection, refer toURL redirection. Front Door doesn't sort the routes for your web application. Instead, it chooses the route that best fits the request. To find out how Front Door matches requests to routes, seeHow Front Door matches requests to a routing rule. To ensure optimal performance of Front Door's features, you should only allow traffic that comes from Azure Front Door to reach your origin. As a result, unauthorized or malicious requests encounter the security and routing policies of Front Door and are denied access. To learn how to secure your origin, seeSecure traffic to Azure Front Door origins. The IP address of your Front Door's frontend anycast is fixed and might not change as long as you use the Front Door. However, the fixed IP address of your Front Door's frontend anycast isn't a guarantee. Avoid relying on the IP directly. Azure Front Door is a dynamic service that routes traffic to the best available backend. It doesn't offer static or dedicated frontend anycast IPs at this time. Yes. Refer to the MatchedRulesSetName property underAccess Logs. Yes. For more information, seeMicrosoft response to DDoS attacks against HTTP/2. Azure Front Door supports the X-Forwarded-For, X-Forwarded-Host, and X-Forwarded-Proto headers. These headers help Front Door identify the original client IP and protocol. If X-Forwarded-For is already present, Front Door adds the client socket IP to the end of the list. Otherwise, it creates the header with the client socket IP as the value. For X-Forwarded-Host and X-Forwarded-Proto, Front Door replaces the existing values with its own. For more information, seeFront Door supported HTTP headers. The deployment time for new Front Door configurations varies depending on the type of change. Typically, it takes between 3 and 20 minutes for the changes to propagate to all our edge locations worldwide. Note Custom TLS/SSL certificate updates might take longer, from several minutes up to an hour, to be deployed globally. Updates to routes or origin groups/backend pools are seamless and don't cause any downtime (assuming the new configuration is correct). Certificate updates are also done atomically, so there's no risk of outage. No. Currently, Azure Front Door only supports HTTP/1.1 from the edge to the origin. For gRPC to work, HTTP/2 is required. To use Azure Front Door Standard, Premium or (classic) tier, you need a public IP or a DNS name that can be resolved publicly. This requirement of a public IP or a DNS name that can be resolved publicly allows Azure Front Door to route traffic to your backend resources. You can use Azure resources like Application Gateways or Azure Load Balancers to route traffic to resources in a virtual network. If you use Front Door Premium tier, you can use Private Link to connect to origins behind an internal load balancer with a private endpoint. For more information, seeSecure origins with Private Link. An origin group is a collection of origins that can handle similar types of requests. You need a different origin group for each application or workload that is different. In an origin group, you create an origin for every server or service that can serve requests. If your origin has a load balancer, like Azure Application Gateway, or is hosted on a PaaS that has a load balancer, then the origin group only has one origin. Your origin takes care of failover and load balancing between origins that Front Door doesn't see. For example, if you host an application on Azure App Service, how you set up Front Door depends on how many application instances you have: To learn more, seeOrigins and origin groups in Azure Front Door. Azure Front Door is a service that provides fast and reliable web delivery for your applications. It offers features such as caching, load balancing, security, and routing. However, you need to be aware of some timeouts and limits that apply to Azure Front Door. These timeouts and limits include the maximum request size, the maximum response size, the maximum header size, the maximum number of headers, the maximum number of rules, and the maximum number of origin groups. You can find the detailed information about these timeouts and limits in theAzure Front Door documentation. The configuration updates for most rule sets are done in less than 20 minutes. The rule will be applied right after the update is finished. Azure Front Door and Azure CDN are two services that provide fast and reliable web delivery for your applications. However, they aren't compatible with each other, because they share the same network of Azure edge sites to deliver content to your users. This shared network causes conflicts between their routing and caching policies. Therefore, you have to choose either Azure Front Door or Azure CDN for your application, depending on your performance and security requirements. The fact that both profiles would use the same Azure edge sites to handle incoming requests causes this limitation that prevents you from nesting one Azure Front Door profile behind another. This setup would cause routing conflicts and performance issues. Therefore, you should ensure that your Azure Front Door profiles are independent and not chained together, if you need to use multiple profiles for your applications. Azure Front Door uses three service tags to manage the traffic between your clients and your origins: For more information on Azure Front Door service tags scenarios, seeavailable service tags. Azure Front Door has a 5-second timeout for receiving headers from client. The connection is terminated if the client doesn't send headers within 5 seconds to Azure Front Door after establishing TCP/TLS connection. You can't configure this timeout value. Azure Front Door has a 90-second HTTP keep-alive timeout. The connection is terminated if the client doesn't send data for 90 seconds, which is the HTTP keep-alive timeout for Azure Front Door. You can't configure this timeout value. You can't use the same domains for more than one Front Door endpoint, because Front Door needs to distinguish the route (protocol + host + path combination) for each request. If you have duplicate routes across different endpoints, Azure Front Door can't process the requests correctly. At this time, we don't offer the option to move domains from one endpoint to another without any interruption in service. You need to plan for some downtime if you want to migrate your domains to a different endpoint. Azure Front Door Private Link feature is region agnostic and will work even if you choose a region that is different from the region where your origin is located. In such cases, to ensure lower latency, you should always pick an Azure region closest to your origin when choosing to enable Azure Front Door Private Link endpoint. We are in the process of enabling support for more regions. Once a new region is supported, you can follow theseinstructionsto gradually shift traffic to the new region. Azure Front Door is a platform that distributes traffic across the world and can scale up to meet your application's demands. It uses Microsoft's global network edge to deliver global load-balancing capability that lets you switch your entire application or specific microservices to different regions or clouds if there was failure. To avoid errors when delivering large files, make sure your origin server includes theContent-Rangeheader in the response, and that the header value matches the actual size of the response body. You can find more details on how to configure your origin and Front Door for large file delivery inDelivery of large files. Domain fronting is a network technique that enables an attacker to conceal the actual destination of a malicious request by using a different domain name in the TLS handshake and the HTTP host header. Azure Front Door (Standard, Premium and Classic tier) or Azure CDN Standard from Microsoft (classic) resources created after November 8, 2022, have domain fronting blocking enabled. Rather than blocking a request with mismatched SNI and host headers, we permit the discrepancy if the two domains belong to the same subscription and are included in the routes/routing rules. Domain fronting blocking enforcement will start on January 22, 2024, for all existing domains. The enforcement may require up to two weeks to propagate to all regions. When Front Door blocks a request due to a mismatch: For more information about domain fronting, seeSecuring our approach to domain fronting within AzureandProhibiting domain fronting on Azure Front Door and Azure CDN Standard from Microsoft (classic). Front Door uses TLS 1.2 as the minimum version for all profiles created after September 2019. You can choose to use TLS 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 or 1.3 with Azure Front Door. To learn more, read theAzure Front Door end-to-end TLSarticle. Azure Front Door is a service that provides fast and secure web delivery. It allows you to define how your web traffic is routed and optimized across multiple regions and endpoints. Azure Front Door resources, such as Front Door profiles and routing rules, are only charged when they're enabled. However, web application firewall (WAF) policies and rules are charged regardless of their status. Even if you disable a WAF policy or rule, it still incurs costs for you. No. No. AFD does not support dynamic compression for content greater than 8 MB. However, if the content has been already compressed by the origin, Front Door supports serving static compressed content over 8 MB as long as range request is supported and chunked transfer encoding is not enabled. No. For information on logs and other diagnostic capabilities, seeMonitoring metrics and logs for Front Door. You can store diagnostic logs in their own storage account and choose how long to keep them. Alternatively, diagnostic logs can be sent to Event Hubs or Azure Monitor logs. For more information, seeAzure Front Door diagnostics. To access the audit logs of Azure Front Door, you need to visit the portal. Select your Front Door from the menu page and select onActivity Log. The Activity Log provides you with the records of your Azure Front Doorâ€™s operations. You can set up alerts for Azure Front Door based onmetrics or logs. By doing so, you can monitor the performance and health of your front-end hosts. To learn how to create alerts for Azure Front Door Standard and Premium, seeconfigure alerts.

Is the service zone resilient?,Yes. Azure DDoS Protection is zone-resilient by default.,"This article summarizes frequently asked questions about Azure Site Recovery. For specific scenarios, review these articles: Site Recovery contributes to your business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) strategy, by orchestrating and automating replication of Azure VMs between regions, on-premises virtual machines and physical servers to Azure, and on-premises machines to a secondary datacenter.Learn more. No, Azure Site Recovery  doesn't support Docker workloads running on virtual machines. To protect these virtual machines with Site Recovery, exclude the disks that have Docker installed on them. There are various measures taken by Site Recovery to ensure data integrity. A secure connection is established between all services by using the HTTPS protocol. This makes sure that any malware or outside entities can't tamper the data. Another measure taken is using checksums. The data transfer between source and target is executed by computing checksums of data between them. This ensures that the transferred data is consistent. Azure  doesn't support persistent MAC addresses and so software with MAC based license models cannot be used for both on-premises to Azure migration or disaster recovery. No, Azure Site Recovery currently  doesn't support Ephemeral Disks. Microsoft Azure Recovery Services agent is used for configuring/registering with Site Recovery services, and for monitoring the health of all the components. This component is one of the basic building blocks of the entire Azure Site Recovery on-premises infrastructure. It helps to replicate your workloads to another Azure region from an on-premises site, and fail over to Azure in a disaster. Yes, Site Recovery supports both dedicated and shared infrastructure models. No. Tenant identity remains anonymous. Your tenants don't need access to the Site Recovery portal. Only the service provider administrator interacts with the portal. When you're replicating to Azure, application data is sent to Azure storage but not to the Site Recovery service. Data is encrypted in-transit (HTTPS), and remains encrypted in Azure. No. Azure's billing relationship is directly with the service provider. Service providers are responsible for generating specific bills for their tenants. No, Data is replicated to Azure storage in your subscription. When you perform a test failover (disaster recovery drill) or an actual failover, Site Recovery automatically creates virtual machines in your subscription. Yes. We support Azure Pack, Cloud Platform System, and System Center based (2012 and higher) deployments.Learn moreabout Azure Pack and Site Recovery integration. No, you can replicate Hyper-V virtual machines only to Azure. ReviewSite Recovery pricingdetails. You can use thepricing calculatorto estimate costs while using Site Recovery. For detailed estimate on costs, run the deployment planner tool forVMwareorHyper-V, and use thecost estimation report. Yes, there are extra charges for cache storage account usage when replicating virtual machines using Site Recovery. The cache storage account costs remain the same when the replica storage is of type managed disks or unmanaged disks. Yes. Every protected instance incurs no Azure Site Recovery charges for the first 31 days. For example, if you have been protecting 10 instances for the last six months and you connect an 11th instance to Azure Site Recovery, there are no charges for the 11th instance for the first 31 days. The first 10 instances continue to incur Azure Site Recovery charges since they've been protected for more than 31 days. Yes, even though Site Recovery is free during the first 31 days of a protected instance, you might incur charges for Azure Storage, storage transactions, and data transfer. A recovered virtual machine might also incur Azure compute charges. There isn't any separate cost for disaster recovery drill. There is compute charges after the virtual machine is created after the test failover. No, Site Recovery doesn't intercept replicated data, and doesn't have any information about what's running on your virtual machines or physical servers.
Replication data is exchanged between on-premises Hyper-V hosts, VMware hypervisors, or physical servers and Azure storage or your secondary site. Site Recovery has no ability to intercept that data. Only the metadata needed to orchestrate replication and failover is sent to the Site Recovery service. Site Recovery is ISO 27001:2013, 27018, HIPAA, DPA certified, and is in the process of SOC2 and FedRAMP JAB assessments. Yes. When you create a Site Recovery vault in a region, we ensure that all metadata that we need to enable and orchestrate replication and failover remains within that region's geographic boundary. For virtual machines and physical servers replicating to Azure, both encryption-in-transit andencryption-at-rest (in Azure)are supported. Yes, TLS 1.2 protocol is enforced by default for Azure-to-Azure Site Recovery scenario. Mobility agents installed on the replicated items communicate to Process Server only on TLS 1.2. However, communication from Configuration Server to Azure and from Process Server to Azure could be on TLS 1.1 or 1.0. Follow theguidanceto enforce TLS 1.2 on all Configuration Servers and Process Servers set up by you. Note The modernized experience uses TLS 1.2 for all the communication and enforces it by default. All communication between the microservices of Azure Site Recovery happens on TLS 1.2 protocol. Site Recovery uses security providers configured in the system (OS) and uses the latest available TLS protocol. One needs to explicitly enable the TLS 1.2 in the Registry and then Site Recovery will start using TLS 1.2 for communication with services. You can switch on the managed identity of the recovery services vault by going to theIdentitysetting. Once the vault gets registered with Microsoft Entra ID, you can go to your storage accounts and give the following role-assignments to the vault: Cache storage account is not supported for managed identity. Azure Site Recovery doesn't track source virtual machine changes outside the Source OS.
For example, If you are using Azure to Azure replication and change the size of the source virtual machine, the change in size of source virtual machine isn't  replicated to the target virtual machine. You can use Site Recovery to protect most workloads running on a supported virtual machine or physical server. Site Recovery provides support for application-aware replication, so that apps can be recovered to an intelligent state. It integrates with Microsoft applications such as SharePoint, Exchange, Dynamics, SQL Server and Active Directory, and works closely with leading vendors, including Oracle, SAP, IBM, and Red Hat.Learn moreabout workload protection. Yes. When you use Site Recovery to orchestrate replication and failover in your branch offices, you'll get a unified orchestration and view of all your branch office workloads in a central location. You can easily run failovers and administer disaster recovery of all branches from your head office, without visiting the branches. Yes, Site Recovery supports disaster for Azure virtual machines between Azure regions.Review common questionsabout Azure virtual machine disaster recovery. If you want to replicate between two Azure regions on the same continent, use our Azure to Azure disaster recovery offering. No need to set up configuration server/process server and ExpressRoute connections. Yes, Site Recovery supports disaster recovery of on-premises VMware virtual machines.Review common questionsfor disaster recovery of VMware virtual machines. Yes, Site Recovery supports disaster recovery of on-premises Hyper-V virtual machines.Review common questionsfor disaster recovery of Hyper-V virtual machines. Yes, Site Recovery supports disaster recovery of on-premises physical servers running Windows and Linux to Azure. Learn about requirements for disaster recovery toAzure.
The physical servers run as virtual machines in Azure after failover. Failback from Azure to an on-premises physical server isn't currently supported. You can only fail back to a VMware virtual machine. No, Azure Site Recovery doesn't support move of Recovery Services vault that has protected virtual machines hosted in it. Azure Site Recovery replicates data to an Azure storage account or managed disks, over a public endpoint. However, replication can be performed over Site-to-Site VPN as well. Site-to-Site VPN connectivity allows organizations to connect existing networks to Azure, or Azure networks to each other. Site-to-Site VPN occurs over IPsec tunneling over the internet, using existing on-premises edge network equipment and network appliances in Azure, either native features like Azure Virtual Private Network (VPN) Gateway or third party options such as Check Point CloudGuard, Palo Alto NextGen Firewall. Our partner, Riverbed, provides detailed guidance on working with Azure Site Recovery. Review theirsolution guide. Yes,ExpressRoute can be usedto replicate on-premises virtual machines to Azure. Using storage accounts as target storage  isn't supported by Azure Site Recovery. It is recommended to rather use managed disks as the target storage for your machines. Managed disks only support LRS type for data resiliency. Extended or chained replication isn't supported. Request this feature infeedback forum. This isn't supported. Request this feature in thefeedback forum. This is supported when you're replicating VMware virtual machines and Hyper-V virtual machines to Azure, using the Azure portal. Dynamic disks are supported when replicating Hyper-V virtual machines, and when replicating VMware virtual machines and physical machines to Azure. The operating system disk must be a basic disk. Yes. You can read more about throttling bandwidth in these articles: Yes. Azure Site Recovery for Linux Operation System supports application custom scripts for app-consistency. The custom script with pre and post-options is used by the Azure Site Recovery Mobility Agent during app-consistency. Following are the steps to enable it. Sign in as root into the machine. Change directory to Azure Site Recovery Mobility Agent install location. Default is ""/usr/local/ASR""# cd /usr/local/ASR Change directory to ""VX/scripts"" under install location# cd VX/scripts Create a bash shell script named ""customscript.sh"" with execute permissions for root user.a. The script should support ""--pre"" and ""--post"" (Note the double dashes) command-line optionsb. When the script is called with pre-option, it should freeze the application input/output and when called with post-option, it should thaw the application input/output.c. A sample template - # cat customscript.sh Note The Site Recovery agent version should be 9.24 or above to support custom scripts. A replication policy defines the settings for the retention history of recovery points. The policy also defines the frequency of app-consistent snapshots. By default, Azure Site Recovery creates a new replication policy with default settings of: A crash-consistent recovery point has the on-disk data as if you pulled the power cord from the server during the snapshot. The crash-consistent recovery point doesn't include anything that was in memory when the snapshot was taken. Today, most applications can recover well from crash-consistent snapshots. A crash-consistent recovery point is enough for no-database operating systems and applications like file servers, DHCP servers, and print servers. Site Recovery creates a crash-consistent recovery point every 5 minutes. Application-consistent recovery points are created from application-consistent snapshots. Application-consistent recovery points capture the same data as crash-consistent snapshots while also capturing data in memory and all transactions in process. Because of their extra content, application-consistent snapshots are the most involved and take the longest. We recommend application-consistent recovery points for database operating systems and applications such as SQL Server. Note Creation of application-consistent recovery points fails on Windows machine, if it has more than 64 volumes. Application-consistent recovery points capture all the data in memory and in process. Because recovery points capture that data, they require framework like Volume Shadow Copy Service on Windows to quiesce the application. If the capturing process is frequent, it can affect performance when the workload is already busy. We don't recommend that you use low frequency for app-consistent recovery points for non-database workloads. Even for database workload, 1 hour is enough. Site Recovery can create an application-consistent recovery point with a minimum frequency of 1 hour. To understand how Site Recovery generates recovery points, let's see an example of a replication policy. This replication policy has a recovery point with a 1-day retention window and an app-consistent frequency snapshot of 1 hour. Site Recovery creates a crash-consistent recovery point every 5 minutes. You can't change this frequency. For the most recent 2 hours, you can choose from 24 crash-consistent points and 2 app-consistent points. As time progresses, Site Recovery prunes all the recovery points beyond the last 2 hours and saves only one recovery point per hour for up to 24 hours of the day. The following screenshot illustrates the example. In the screenshot: Within the past 2 hours, there are recovery points with a frequency of 5 minutes. Beyond the past 2 hours, Site Recovery keeps only one recovery point per hour.  The oldest recovery point that you can use is 15 days with Managed disk and three days with Unmanaged disk. No, Site Recovery keeps all your previous recovery points. Depending on the recovery points' retention window, Site Recovery replaces the oldest point only if it generates new points. Because of the problem, Site Recovery can't generate any new recovery points. Until there are new recovery points, all the old points remain after you reach the window of retention. Go toSite Recovery Vault>Site Recovery Infrastructure>Replication policies. Select the policy that you want to edit, and save the changes. Any change applies to all the existing replications too. The first recovery point that's generated has the complete copy. Any successive recovery points have delta changes. Yes, if you increase the retention period from one day to three days, Site Recovery saves the recovery points for an extra two days. The added time will incur storage charges since there will be 12 additional recovery points that need to be saved with increase in retention period from one day to three days. For example, a single recovery point might have delta changes of 10 GB with a per-GB cost of $0.16 per month. Additional charges would be $1.60 Ã— 12 per month. You can access the Azure virtual machines over a secure Internet connection, over a site-to-site VPN, or over Azure ExpressRoute. You need to prepare a number of things in order to connect.Learn more. Azure is designed for resilience. Site Recovery is already engineered for failover to a secondary Azure datacenter, in accordance with the Azure SLA. If this happens, we make sure your metadata and vaults remain within the same geographic region that you chose for your vault. You can trigger an unplanned failover from the secondary site. Site Recovery doesn't need connectivity from the primary site to perform the failover. Failover isn't automatic. You initiate failovers with single click in the portal, or you can useSite Recovery PowerShellto trigger a failover. Failing back is a simple action in the Site Recovery portal. To automate you could use on-premises Orchestrator or Operations Manager to detect a virtual machine failure, and then trigger the failover using the SDK. Yes, you can use the alternate location recovery to failback to a different host from Azure. Once a machine from source location has been failed over to the target location then there are three options available for you to choose from. All three serve different purposes - Yes. You can automate Site Recovery workflows using the REST API, PowerShell, or the Azure SDK. Currently supported scenarios for deploying Site Recovery using PowerShell: No, the retirement of the AzureRM module doesn't affect how Site Recovery automatic updates work. No changes are needed for the internal runbook, and the REST API used in place, continues to function as intended with the automation account. Learnabout new updates, andget rollup information.

How do I configure the service to be zone-resilient?,No customer configuration is necessary to enable zone-resiliency. Zone-resiliency for Azure DDoS Protection resources is available by default and managed by the service itself.,"Here are some frequently asked questions (FAQs) and answers for Service Fabric managed clusters. Service Fabric managed clusters are an evolution of the Service Fabric cluster resource model designed to make it easier to deploy and manage clusters. A Service Fabric managed cluster uses the Azure Resource Manager encapsulation model so that a user only needs to define and deploy a single cluster resource compared to the many independent resources that they must deploy today (Virtual Machine Scale Set, Load Balancer, IP, and more). Service Fabric managed clusters are supported in all cloud regions. No, you need to create a new Service Fabric cluster resource to use the new Service Fabric managed cluster resource type. No, there's no additional cost associated with a Service Fabric managed cluster beyond the cost of the underlying compute, storage, and networking resources that are required for the cluster. The SLA doesn't change from the current Service Fabric resource model. Basic SKU clusters are intended to be used for testing and pre production environments with support for minimal configuration change. A Standard SKU cluster allows users to configure the cluster to specifically meet their needs. For more information, seeService Fabric managed cluster SKUs.

The user data is never interpreted or modified by any other component than the EAP method itself. The terms ""user data"" and ""credentials"" are synonymous. An ""EAP attribute"" is a data structure that contains a predetermined type of data. Attributes are used to communicate information between EAP methods and supplicants, or between EAP methods and authenticators. Peer and authenticator implementations of an EAP method may exchange these attributes over a network. Yes. Be sure to specify the distinction when configuring the registry entries for the EAP method itself. The configuration path and peer path must be the same. Yes. Be sure to specify the distinction when configuring the registry entries for the EAP method itself. The configuration and peer paths must point to the correct DLLs. To install an EAP method, you must first implementDllRegisterServerandDllUnregisterServerin the EAP method DLL itself. After that, useregsvr32.exeto install and uninstall the method. The appropriate registry keys must also be set. For more information, seeInstalling an EAP Method. When in-bandNAPsupport is enabled, NAP packets are transported inside EAP method packets. In contrast, when out-of-band NAP support is enabled, the NAPStatement of Health(SoH) exchange occurs through means other than internal to EAP method packets, and NAP-generated certificates are used in EAP method authentication. Yes, in-band NAP support for your EAP method can be enabled. For more information, seeEnabling In-Band NAP Support for EAP Methods. The EAP-FAST scenario works as follows. A method of transmitting and receiving digital signals in which the phase of a transmitted signal is varied to convey information. TheEAPConfigInputPSKinput field contains the user's EAP-FAST PSK. Microsoft Windows-32-bit-On-Windows-64-bit (WOW) is an operating system component in 64-bit Windows that supports 32-bit x86 platform application. Typically, a EAP method author would define some form of C/C++ structure to encapsulate configuration data, credential data, and interactive UI data. To avoid incompatibilities in WOW and other scenarios, it is important to ensure that data structures are aligned similarly in different processor architectures (32-bit and 64-bit processors). Typically dummy padding is used to align the fields so that the configuration, credential and interactive UI data are identical on both 32-and 64-bit processors. ""Action codes"" allow methods to control the flow of authentication, and are integral to the state machine. They are values returned by an EAP method to indicate the next action the EAPHost should take. For example, an action code could indicate to EAPHost that the EAP method has a packet ready for transmission. The supplicant abides by all action codes returned by an EAP method, but never issues action codes.For more information, seeEAP Peer Supplicant Action Codes. EapPeerMethodResponseActionDiscardis returned by an EAP method to indicate to the EAPHost that it must discard the packet it supplied to the method. Specifically, the method has determined that the packet is invalid. EAPHost then waits for the next package. EapPeerMethodResponseActionSendis returned by an EAP method to indicate to EAPHost that the next packet received by EAPHost must be sent to the network access server (NAS). EapPeerMethodResponseActionResultis returned by an EAP method to indicate to the EAPHost that the authentication session has concluded and that the results of that session are available. EapPeerMethodResponseActionInvokeUIis returned by an EAP method to indicate to EAPHost that user input is required to continue with authentication, and that a user interface dialog box must be displayed to obtain that input. Once the user input data has been obtained, EAPHost can call the EAP method again with the updated UI context data. EapPeerMethodResponseActionRespondis returned by an EAP method to indicate to EAPHost that the EAP method has attributes available for EAPHost to use during authentication.

Are services unsafe in Azure without the service?,"Services running on Azure are inherently protected by the default infrastructure-level DDoS protection. However, the protection that safeguards the infrastructure has a much higher threshold than most applications have the capacity to handle, and does not provide telemetry or alerting, so while a traffic volume may be perceived as harmless by the platform, it can be devastating to the application that receives it. 
 By onboarding to the Azure DDoS Protection Service, the application gets dedicated monitoring to detect attacks and application specific thresholds. A service will be protected with a profile that is tuned to its expected traffic volume, providing a much tighter defense against DDoS attacks.","Important Cloud Services (classic) is now deprecated for all customers as of September 1st, 2024.

Certificates Monitoring and logging Network configuration Permissions Scaling Generic We recommend that customers install the full certificate chain (leaf cert, intermediate certs, and root cert) instead of just the leaf certificate. When you install just the leaf certificate, you rely on Windows to build the certificate chain by walking the Certificate Trust List (CTL). If intermittent network or Domain Name System (DNS) issues occur in Azure or Windows Update when Windows is trying to validate the certificate, the certificate may be considered invalid. When you install the full certificate chain, this problem can be avoided. The blog atHow to install a chained SSL certificateshows how to do install the full certificate chain. These certificates are automatically created whenever an extension is added to the Cloud Service. Most commonly, this extension is the WAD extension or the RDP extension, but it could be others, such as the Antimalware or Log Collector extension. These certificates are only used for encrypting and decrypting the private configuration for the extension. The expiration date is never checked, so it doesnâ€™t matter if the certificate is expired.â€¯ Youâ€¯can ignore these certificates. Ifâ€¯you wantâ€¯to clean up the certificates, you can try deleting them all. Azure throws an error if you try to delete a certificate that is in use. See the following guidance document: Obtaining a certificate for use with Microsoft Azure Web Sites (WAWS) The CSR is just a text file. It doesn't have to be created from the machine intended to use the certificate.â€¯Although this document is written for an App Service, the CSR creation is generic and applies also for Cloud Services. You can use following PowerShell commands to renew your Management Certificates: TheGet-AzurePublishSettingsFilecreates a new management certificate inSubscription>Management Certificatesin the Azure portal. The name of the new certificate looks like ""YourSubscriptionNam]-[CurrentDate]-credentials"". You can automate this task by using a startup script (batch/cmd/PowerShell) and register that startup script in the service definition file. Add both the startup script and certificate(.p7b file) in the project folder of the same directory of the startup script. This certificate is used to encrypt machine keys on Azure Web Roles.

To set up a static IP address, you need to create a reserved IP. This reserved IP can be associated to a new Cloud Service or to an existing deployment. See the following documents for details: Azure has IPS/IDS in datacenter physical servers to defend against threats. In addition, customers can deploy non-Microsoft security solutions, such as web application firewalls, network firewalls, antimalware, intrusion detection, prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and more. For more information, seeProtect your data and assets and comply with global security standards. Microsoft continuously monitors servers, networks, and applications to detect threats. Azure's multipronged threat-management approach uses intrusion detection, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack prevention, penetration testing, behavioral analytics, anomaly detection, and machine learning to constantly strengthen its defense and reduce risks.

You can deploy non-Microsoft security solutions in addition, such as web application fire walls, network firewalls, antimalware, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and more. Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 come with support for HTTP/2 on both client and server side. If your client (browser) is connecting to the IIS server over Transport Layer Security (TLS) that negotiates HTTP/2 via TLS extensions, then you don't need to make any change on the server-side. You don't need to make changes because the h2-14 header specifying use of HTTP/2 is sent by default over TLS. If on the other hand your client is sending an Upgrade header to upgrade to HTTP/2, then you need to make the following change on the server side to ensure that the Upgrade works and you end up with an HTTP/2 connection. For more information, see: These steps could be automated via a startup task, so that whenever a new PaaS instance gets created, it can make the previous changes in the system registry. For more information, seeHow to configure and run startup tasks for a Cloud Service. When you finish, you can verify whether the HTTP/2 is enabled or not by using one of the following methods: For more information, seeHTTP/2 on IIS. Cloud Services doesn't support the Azure role-based access control model, as it's not an Azure Resource Manager based service. SeeUnderstand the different roles in Azure. Microsoft follows a strict process that doesn't allow internal engineers to remote desktop into your Cloud Service without written permission (email or other written communication) from the owner or their designee. This error may occur if you use the RDP file from a machine that is joined to Microsoft Entra ID. To resolve this issue, follow these steps: Your Azure Subscription has a limit on the number of cores you can use. Scaling doesn't work if you used all the cores available. For example, if you have a limit of 100 cores, this means you could have 100 A1 sized virtual machine instances for your Cloud Service, or 50 A2 sized virtual machine instances. Autoscale based on Memory metrics for a Cloud Services isn't currently supported. To work around this problem, you can use Application Insights. Auto-Scale supports Application Insights as a Metrics Source and can scale the role instance count based on guest metric like ""Memory.""  You have to configure Application Insights in your Cloud Service project package file (*.cspkg) and enable Azure Diagnostics extension on the service to implement this feat. For more information on how to utilize a custom metric via Application Insights to configure Auto-Scale on  Cloud Services, seeGet started with auto scale by custom metric in Azure For more information on how to integrate Azure Diagnostics with Application Insights for Cloud Services, seeSend Cloud Service, Virtual Machine, or Service Fabric diagnostic data to Application Insights For more information about to enable Application Insights for Cloud Services, seeApplication Insights for Azure Cloud Services For more information about how to enable Azure Diagnostics Logging for Cloud Services, seeSet up diagnostics for Azure Cloud Services and virtual machines To prevent clients from sniffing the MIME types, add a setting in yourweb.configfile. You can also add this as a setting in IIS. Use the following command with thecommon startup tasksarticle. Use the IIS startup script from thecommon startup tasksarticle. SeeService-specific limits. This behavior is expected, and it shouldn't cause any issue to your application. Journaling is turned on for the %approot% drive in Azure PaaS VMs, which essentially consumes double the amount of space that files normally take up. However, there are several things to be aware of that turn this event into a nonissue. The %approot% drive size is calculated as <size of .cspkg + max journal size + a margin of free space>, or 1.5 GB, whichever is larger. The size of your VM has no bearing on this calculation. (The VM size only affects the size of the temporary C: drive.)â€¯ It's unsupported to write to the %approot% drive. If you're writing to the Azure VM, you must do so in a temporary LocalStorage resource (or other option, such as Blob storage, Azure Files, etc.). So the amount of free space on the %approot% folder isn't meaningful. If you aren't sure if your application is writing to the %approot% drive, you can always let your service run for a few days and then compare the ""before"" and ""after"" sizes.â€¯ Azure doesn't write anything to the %approot% drive. Once the virtual hard disk (VHD) is created from your.cspkgand mounted into the Azure VM, the only thing that might write to this drive is your application.â€¯ The journal settings are nonconfigurable, so you can't turn it off.

Certificates Monitoring and logging Network configuration Permissions Scaling Generic We recommend that customers install the full certificate chain (leaf cert, intermediate certs, and root cert) instead of just the leaf certificate. When you install just the leaf certificate, you rely on Windows to build the certificate chain by walking the Certificate Trust List (CTL). If intermittent network or Domain Name System (DNS) issues occur in Azure or Windows Update when Windows is trying to validate the certificate, the certificate may be considered invalid. When you install the full certificate chain, this problem can be avoided. The blog atHow to install a chained SSL certificateshows how to do install the full certificate chain. These certificates are automatically created whenever an extension is added to the Cloud Service. Most commonly, this extension is the WAD extension or the RDP extension, but it could be others, such as the Antimalware or Log Collector extension. These certificates are only used for encrypting and decrypting the private configuration for the extension. The expiration date is never checked, so it doesnâ€™t matter if the certificate is expired.â€¯ Youâ€¯can ignore these certificates. Ifâ€¯you wantâ€¯to clean up the certificates, you can try deleting them all. Azure throws an error if you try to delete a certificate that is in use. See the following guidance document: Obtaining a certificate for use with Microsoft Azure Web Sites (WAWS) The CSR is just a text file. It doesn't have to be created from the machine intended to use the certificate.â€¯Although this document is written for an App Service, the CSR creation is generic and applies also for Cloud Services. You can use following PowerShell commands to renew your Management Certificates: TheGet-AzurePublishSettingsFilecreates a new management certificate inSubscription>Management Certificatesin the Azure portal. The name of the new certificate looks like ""YourSubscriptionNam]-[CurrentDate]-credentials"". You can automate this task by using a startup script (batch/cmd/PowerShell) and register that startup script in the service definition file. Add both the startup script and certificate(.p7b file) in the project folder of the same directory of the startup script. This certificate is used to encrypt machine keys on Azure Web Roles. To learn more, check outthis advisory. For more information, see the following articles: Ability to generate a new certificate for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is coming soon. Alternatively, you can run this script: Ability to choose blob or local for your csdef and cscfg upload location is coming soon. UsingNew-AzureDeployment, you can set each location value.

You can specify the timeout in your service definition (csdef) file like this: SeeNew: Configurable Idle Timeout for Azure Load Balancerfor more information. To set up a static IP address, you need to create a reserved IP. This reserved IP can be associated to a new Cloud Service or to an existing deployment. See the following documents for details: Azure has IPS/IDS in datacenter physical servers to defend against threats. In addition, customers can deploy non-Microsoft security solutions, such as web application firewalls, network firewalls, antimalware, intrusion detection, prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and more. For more information, seeProtect your data and assets and comply with global security standards. Microsoft continuously monitors servers, networks, and applications to detect threats. Azure's multipronged threat-management approach uses intrusion detection, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack prevention, penetration testing, behavioral analytics, anomaly detection, and machine learning to constantly strengthen its defense and reduce risks. Microsoft Antimalware for Azure protects Azure Cloud Services and virtual machines. You can deploy non-Microsoft security solutions in addition, such as web application fire walls, network firewalls, antimalware, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and more. Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 come with support for HTTP/2 on both client and server side. If your client (browser) is connecting to the IIS server over Transport Layer Security (TLS) that negotiates HTTP/2 via TLS extensions, then you don't need to make any change on the server-side. You don't need to make changes because the h2-14 header specifying use of HTTP/2 is sent by default over TLS. If on the other hand your client is sending an Upgrade header to upgrade to HTTP/2, then you need to make the following change on the server side to ensure that the Upgrade works and you end up with an HTTP/2 connection. For more information, see: These steps could be automated via a startup task, so that whenever a new PaaS instance gets created, it can make the previous changes in the system registry. For more information, seeHow to configure and run startup tasks for a Cloud Service. When you finish, you can verify whether the HTTP/2 is enabled or not by using one of the following methods: For more information, seeHTTP/2 on IIS.

For more information, see these articles: Every time I try to create an image from my VHDs, I get the error ""VHD is already registered with image repository as the resource"" in Azure PowerShell. I didn't create any image before nor did I find any image with this name in Azure. How do I resolve this issue? This issue usually appears if you created a VM from a VHD that has a lock on it. Confirm that there's no VM allocated from this VHD and then retry the operation. If this issue continues, open a support ticket. SeeSupport for Partner Center. This section describes how to create and deploy a user-provided virtual machine (VM) image by providing operating system and data disk VHD images from an Azure-deployed virtual hard disk. These steps deploy the VM using generalized VHD. Sign in to the Azure portal. Upload your generalized operating system VHD and data disk VHDs to your Azure Storage account. On the home page, selectCreate a resource. Search for ""template deployment"" and selectCreate. Choose Build your own template in the editor.  Paste the following JSON template into the editor and selectSave. Provide the parameter values for the displayed Custom deployment property pages. After you supply these values, selectPurchase. Azure begins the deployment. It creates a new VM with the specified unmanaged VHD in the specified storage account path. You can track the progress in the Azure portal by selecting Virtual Machines on the left side of the portal. When the VM is created, the status changes from Starting to Running. For generation 2 VM deployment, use this template: Copy and edit the following script to provide values for the$storageaccountand$vhdUrlvariables. Execute it to create an Azure VM resource from your existing generalized VHD. You can deploy hidden preview images using quickstart templates.

Can I manually configure the DDoS policy applied to the VNets/Public IPs?,"No, unfortunately policy customization is not available at this moment.","Azure Firewall is a managed, cloud-based network security service that protects your Azure Virtual Network resources. It's a fully stateful firewall-as-a-service with built-in high availability and unrestricted cloud scalability. You can centrally create, enforce, and log application and network connectivity policies across subscriptions and virtual networks. To learn about Azure Firewall features, seeAzure Firewall features. You can deploy Azure Firewall on any virtual network, but customers typically deploy it on a central virtual network and peer other virtual networks to it in a hub-and-spoke model. You can then set the default route from the peered virtual networks to point to this central firewall virtual network. Global VNet peering is supported, but it isn't recommended because of potential performance and latency issues across regions. For best performance, deploy one firewall per region. The advantage of this model is the ability to centrally exert control on multiple spoke VNETs across different subscriptions. There are also cost savings as you don't need to deploy a firewall in each VNet separately. The cost savings should be measured versus the associate peering cost based on the customer traffic patterns. You can set up Azure Firewall by using the Azure portal, PowerShell, REST API, or by using templates. SeeTutorial: Deploy and configure Azure Firewall using the Azure portalfor step-by-step instructions. Azure Firewall supports rules and rule collections. A rule collection is a set of rules that share the same order and priority. Rule collections are executed in order of their priority. DNAT rule collections are higher priority network rule collections,  which are higher priority than application rule collections, and all rules are terminating. There are three types of rule collections: For more information, seeConfigure Azure Firewall rules. Azure Firewall supports inbound and outbound filtering. Inbound protection is typically used for non-HTTP protocols like RDP, SSH, and FTP protocols. For inbound HTTP and HTTPS protection, use a web application firewall such asAzure Web Application Firewall (WAF)or the TLS offload and deep packet inspection capabilities ofAzure Firewall Premium. Yes,  Azure Firewall Basic supports forced tunneling. Azure Firewall is integrated with Azure Monitor for viewing and analyzing firewall logs. Logs can be sent to Log Analytics, Azure Storage, or Event Hubs. They can be analyzed in Log Analytics or by different tools such as Excel and Power BI. For more information, seeTutorial: Monitor Azure Firewall logs. Azure Firewall is a managed, cloud-based network security service that protects your virtual network resources. It's a fully stateful firewall as a service with built-in high availability and unrestricted cloud scalability. It's pre-integrated with third-party security as a service (SECaaS) providers to provide advanced security for your virtual network and branch Internet connections. To learn more about Azure network security, seeAzure network security. The Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a feature of Application Gateway that provides centralized inbound protection of your web applications from common exploits and vulnerabilities. Azure Firewall provides inbound protection for non-HTTP/S protocols (for example, RDP, SSH, FTP), outbound network-level protection for all ports and protocols, and application-level protection for outbound HTTP/S. The Azure Firewall service complements network security group functionality. Together, they provide better ""defense-in-depth"" network security. Network security groups provide distributed network layer traffic filtering to limit traffic to resources within virtual networks in each subscription. Azure Firewall is a fully stateful, centralized network firewall as-a-service, which provides network- and application-level protection across different subscriptions and virtual networks. Azure Firewall is a managed service with multiple protection layers, including platform protection with NIC level NSGs (not viewable).  Subnet level NSGs aren't required on the AzureFirewallSubnet, and are disabled to ensure no service interruption. For secure access to PaaS services, we recommend service endpoints. You can choose to enable service endpoints in the Azure Firewall subnet and disable them on the connected spoke virtual networks. This way you benefit from both features: service endpoint security and central logging for all traffic. SeeAzure Firewall Pricing. You can use Azure PowerShelldeallocateandallocatemethods. For a firewall configured for forced tunneling, the procedure is slightly different. For example, for a firewall configured with the Management NIC NOT enabled: For a firewall configured with the Management NIC enabled, stopping is the same. But starting requires the management public IP to be re-associated back to the firewall: For a firewall in a secured virtual hub architecture, stopping is the same but starting must use the virtual hub ID: When you allocate and deallocate,firewall billingstops and starts accordingly. Note You must reallocate a firewall and public IP to the original resource group and subscription.
When stop/start is performed, the private IP address of the firewall may change to a different IP address within the subnet.  This can affect the connectivity of previously configured route tables. The recommendation is to configure availability zones during the initial firewall deployment. However, in some cases it's possible to change availability zones after deployment. The prerequisites are: Reconfiguring availability zones can only be done when you restart the firewall. First you need to deallocate the firewall (by using '$azfw.Deallocate()'), then change the zone configuration and then allocate the firewall (by using  '$azfw.Allocate()'). After you allocate the firewall, and right before starting the firewall withSet-AzFirewall, use the following Azure PowerShell to modify the firewall'sZonesproperty: For Azure Firewall service limits, seeAzure subscription and service limits, quotas, and constraints. Yes, you can use Azure Firewall in a hub virtual network to route and filter traffic between multiple spoke virtual network. Subnets in each of the spoke virtual networks must have a UDR pointing to the Azure Firewall as a default gateway for this scenario to work properly. Yes. However, configuring the UDRs to redirect traffic between subnets in the same VNET requires more attention. While using the VNET address range as a target prefix for the UDR is sufficient, this also routes all traffic from one machine to another machine in the same subnet through the Azure Firewall instance. To avoid this, include a route for the subnet in the UDR with a next hop type ofVNET. Managing these routes might be cumbersome and prone to error. The recommended method for internal network segmentation is to use Network Security Groups, which don't require UDRs. Azure Firewall doesn't SNAT when the destination IP address is a private IP range perIANA RFC 1918orIANA RFC 6598for private networks. If your organization uses a public IP address range for private networks, Azure Firewall SNATs the traffic to one of the firewall private IP addresses in AzureFirewallSubnet. You can configure Azure Firewall tonotSNAT your public IP address range. For more information, seeAzure Firewall SNAT private IP address ranges. In addition, traffic processed by application rules are always SNAT-ed. If you want to see the original source IP address in your logs for FQDN traffic, you can use network rules with the destination FQDN. Forced tunneling is supported when you create a new firewall. You can't configure an existing firewall for forced tunneling. For more information, seeAzure Firewall forced tunneling. Azure Firewall must have direct Internet connectivity. If your AzureFirewallSubnet learns a default route to your on-premises network via BGP, you must override this with a 0.0.0.0/0 UDR with theNextHopTypevalue set asInternetto maintain direct Internet connectivity. If your configuration requires forced tunneling to an on-premises network and you can determine the target IP prefixes for your Internet destinations, you can configure these ranges with the on-premises network as the next hop via a user defined route on the AzureFirewallSubnet. Or, you can use BGP to define these routes. Yes. Examples: Whenever a configuration change is applied, Azure Firewall attempts to update all its underlying backend instances. In rare cases, one of these backend instances might fail to update with the new configuration and the update process  stops with a failed provisioning state. Your Azure Firewall is still operational, but the applied configuration might be in an inconsistent state, where some instances have the previous configuration where others have the updated rule set. If this happens, try updating your configuration one more time until the operation succeeds and your Firewall is in aSucceededprovisioning state. Azure Firewall consists of several backend nodes in an active-active configuration. For any planned maintenance, we have connection draining logic to gracefully update nodes. Updates are planned during nonbusiness hours for each of the Azure regions to further limit risk of disruption. For unplanned issues, we instantiate a new node to replace the failed node. Connectivity to the new node is typically reestablished within 10 seconds from the time of the failure. For any planned maintenance, connection draining logic gracefully updates backend nodes. Azure Firewall waits 90 seconds for existing connections to close. In the first 45 seconds, the backend node doesn't accept new connections, and in the remaining time it responds withRSTto all incoming packets. If needed, clients can automatically re-establish connectivity to another backend node. Yes. There's a 50 character limit for a firewall name. Azure Firewall must provision more virtual machine instances as it scales. A /26 address space ensures that the firewall has enough IP addresses available to accommodate the scaling. No. Azure Firewall doesn't need a subnet bigger than /26. Azure Firewall's initial throughput capacity is 2.5 - 3 Gbps and it scales out to 30 Gbps for Standard SKU and 100 Gbps for Premium SKU. It scales out automatically based on CPU usage, throughput, and the number of connections. Azure Firewall gradually scales when average throughput or CPU consumption is at 60%, or the number of connections usage is at 80%. For example, it starts to scale out when it reaches 60% of its maximum throughput.
Maximum throughput numbers vary based on Firewall SKU and enabled features. For more information, seeAzure Firewall performance. Scale out takes five to seven minutes. When performance testing, make sure you test for at least 10 to 15 minutes, and start new connections to take advantage of newly created Firewall nodes. When a connection has an Idle Timeout (four minutes of no activity), Azure Firewall gracefully terminates the connection by sending a TCP RST packet. An Azure Firewall VM instance shutdown might occur during Virtual Machine Scale Set scale in (scale down) or during fleet software upgrade. In these cases, new incoming connections are load balanced to the remaining firewall instances and aren't forwarded to the down firewall instance. After 45 seconds, the firewall starts rejecting existing connections by sending TCP RST packets. After another 45 seconds the firewall VM shuts down. For more information, seeLoad Balancer TCP Reset and Idle Timeout. No. Azure Firewall blocks Active Directory access by default. To allow access, configure the AzureActiveDirectory service tag. For more information, seeAzure Firewall service tags. Yes, you can use Azure PowerShell to do it: A TCP ping isn't actually connecting  to the target FQDN. Azure Firewall doesn't allow a connection to any target IP address/FQDN unless there's an explicit rule that allows it. TCP ping is a unique use case where if there's no allowed rule, the Firewall itself responds to the client's TCP ping request even though the TCP ping doesn't reach the target IP address/FQDN. In this case, the event isn't logged. If there's a network rule that allows access to the target IP address/FQDN, then the ping request reaches the target server and its response is relayed back to the client. This event is logged in the Network rules log. Yes. For more information, seeAzure subscription and service limits, quotas, and constraints No, moving an IP Group to another resource group isn't currently supported. A standard behavior of a network firewall is to ensure TCP connections are kept alive and to promptly close them if there's no activity. Azure Firewall TCP Idle Timeout is four minutes. This setting isn't user configurable, but you can contact Azure Support to increase the Idle Timeout for inbound and outbound connections up to 15 minutes. Idle Timeout for east-west traffic can't be changed. If a period of inactivity is longer than the timeout value, there's no guarantee that the TCP or HTTP session is maintained. A common practice is to use a TCP keep-alive. This practice keeps the connection active for a longer period. For more information, see the.NET examples. Yes, but you must configure the firewall in Forced Tunneling Mode. This configuration creates a management interface with a public IP address that is used by Azure Firewall for its operations. This public IP address is for management traffic. It's used exclusively by the Azure platform and can't be used for any other purpose. The tenant data path network can be configured without a public IP address, and Internet traffic can be forced tunneled to another Firewall or completely blocked. Azure Firewall doesn't move or store customer data out of the region it's deployed in. Yes. For more information, seeBackup Azure Firewall and Azure Firewall Policy with Logic Apps. No, currently Azure Firewall in secured virtual hubs (vWAN) isn't supported in Qatar. Azure Firewall uses Azure Virtual Machines underneath that have ahard limit number of connections. The total number of active connections per virtual machine is 250k. The total limit per firewall is the virtual machine connection limit (250k) x the number of virtual machines in the firewall backend pool. Azure Firewall starts with two virtual machines and scales out based on CPU usage and throughput. Azure Firewall currently uses TCP/UDP source ports for outbound SNAT traffic, with no idle wait time. When a TCP/UDP connection is closed, the TCP port used is immediately seen as available for upcoming connections. As a workaround for certain architectures, you can deploy and scale withNAT Gateway with Azure Firewallto provide a wider pool of SNAT ports for variability and availability. Specific NAT behaviors depend on the firewall's configuration and the type of NAT that's configured. For example, the firewall has DNAT rules for inbound traffic, and network rules and application rules for outbound traffic through the firewall. For more information, seeAzure Firewall NAT Behaviors.

Applies to This article provides frequently asked questions and answers about anti-spoofing protection for Microsoft 365 organizations with mailboxes in Exchange Online, or standalone Exchange Online Protection (EOP) organizations without Exchange Online mailboxes. For questions and answers about anti-spam protection, seeAnti-spam protection FAQ. For questions and answers about anti-malware protection, seeAnti-malware protection FAQ Microsoft believes that the risk of continuing to allow unauthenticated inbound email is higher than the risk of losing legitimate inbound email. When Microsoft enabled this feature in 2018, some false positives happened (good messages were marked as bad). Over time, senders adjusted to the requirements. The number of messages that were misidentified as spoofed became negligible for most email paths. Microsoft itself first adopted the new email authentication requirements several weeks before deploying it to customers. While there was disruption at first, it gradually declined. Yes. As of October 2018, spoof intelligence is available to all organizations with mailboxes in Exchange Online, and standalone EOP organizations without Exchange Online mailboxes. SeeReport messages and files to Microsoft. We don't recommend disabling anti-spoofing protection. Disabling the protection allows more delivered phishing and spam messages in your organization. Not all phishing is spoofing, and not all spoofed messages will be missed. However, your risk is higher. Now thatEnhanced Filtering for Connectorsis available, we no longer recommended turning off anti-spoofing protection when your email is routed through another service before EOP. Unfortunately, no. Attackers constantly adapt to use other techniques (for example, compromised accounts or accounts in free email services). However, anti-phishing protection works better to detect these other types of phishing methods. The protection layers in EOP are designed work together and build on top of each other. Nearly all large email services implement traditional SPF, DKIM, and DMARC checks. Some services have other, more strict checks, but few go as far as EOP to block unauthenticated email and treat them as spoofed messages. However, the industry is becoming more aware about issues with unauthenticated email, particularly because of the problem of phishing. No. This ASF setting is no longer required. Anti-spoofing protection considers both SPF hard fails and a wider set of criteria. If you have anti-spoofing enabled and theSPF record: hard fail(MarkAsSpamSpfRecordHardFail) turned on, you'll probably get more false positives. We recommend that you disable this feature as it provides almost no additional benefit for detecting spam or phishing message, and would instead generate mostly false positives. For more information, seeAdvanced Spam Filter (ASF) settings in EOP. SRS only partially fixes the problem of forwarded email. By rewriting the SMTPMAIL FROMvalue, SRS can ensure that the forwarded message passes SPF at the next destination. However, because anti-spoofing is based upon theFromaddress in combination with theMAIL FROMor DKIM-signing domain (or other signals), it's not enough to prevent SRS forwarded email from being marked as spoofed. Anti-spoofing protection FAQ In this article Why did Microsoft choose to junk unauthenticated inbound email? Does junking unauthenticated inbound email cause legitimate email to be marked as spam? Is spoof intelligence available to Microsoft 365 customers without Defender for Office 365? How can I report spam or non-spam messages back to Microsoft? What happens if I disable anti-spoofing protection for my organization? Does anti-spoofing protection mean I'm protected from all phishing?

If your resource is under attack, other metrics will start showing up on portal within 5-7 minutes.","This article provides answers to the most frequently asked questions about traffic analytics capability of Azure Network Watcher. To learn how to check roles assigned to a user for a subscription, seeList Azure role assignments using the Azure portal. If you can't see the role assignments, contact the respective subscription admin. Yes, network security groups can be in different regions than your Log Analytics workspace region. Yes. No, traffic analytics doesn't support classic network security groups. In the resource selection dropdown in the traffic analytics dashboard, the resource group of theVirtual Networkresource must be selected, not the resource group of the virtual machine or network security group. Yes. If you select an existing workspace, make sure that it has been migrated to the new query language. If you don't want to upgrade the workspace, you need to create a new one. For more information about Kusto Query Language (KQL), seeLog queries in Azure Monitor. Yes, your Azure storage account can be in one subscription, and your Log Analytics workspace can be in a different subscription. Yes. You can configure flow logs to be sent to a storage account located in a different subscription, provided you have the appropriate privileges, and that the storage account is located in the same region as the network security group (network security group flow logs) or virtual network (virtual network flow logs). The destination storage account must share the same Microsoft Entra tenant of the network security group or virtual network. No. All resources must be in the same tenant including network security groups (network security group flow logs), virtual networks (virtual network flow logs), flow logs, storage accounts and Log Analytics workspaces (if traffic analytics is enabled). Yes. No. If you delete the storage account that is used for flow logs, the data stored in Log Analytics workspace won't be affected. You can still view historic data in Log Analytics workspace (some metrics will be impacted) but traffic analytics will no longer process any new additional flow logs until you update the flow logs to use a different storage account. Select a supported region. If you select a non-supported region, you receive a ""Not found"" error. For more information, seeTraffic analytics supported regions. TheMicrosoft.Insightsprovider must be registered for flow logging to work properly. If you aren't sure whether theMicrosoft.Insightsprovider is registered for your subscription, seeAzure portal,PowerShell, orAzure CLIinstructions on how to register it. The dashboard might take up to 30 minutes to show reports for the first time. The solution must first aggregate enough data for it to derive meaningful insights, then it generates reports.

Applications or PowerShell scripts aren't getting installed.,"
 If the applications or PowerShell scripts are showing  Skipped  in the details of the Windows Autopilot device preparation deployment report, verify that they're assigned to the device group specified in the Windows Autopilot device preparation policy. For more information, see  Windows Autopilot device preparation policy configuration settings  and  Create a device group . 
 
 Verify that the application or PowerShell script is configured to install in the  System  context. During OOBE, applications are installed and PowerShell scripts run when no user is signed in. For this reason, they must be configured to install in the  System  context. 
 
","A PowerShell module is a reusable package containing some PowerShell functionality.
Everything in PowerShell (functions, variables, DSC resources, etc.) can be packaged in
modules. Typically, modules are folders containing specific types of files stored on a
specific path. There are a few different types of PowerShell modules out there. A PowerShell script is a series of commands that are stored in a .ps1 file to enable reuse
and sharing. PowerShell workflows are also PowerShell scripts, which outline a set of
tasks and provide sequencing for those tasks. For more information, please visitGetting Started with PowerShell Workflow. Modules are generally better for sharing, but we are enabling script sharing to make it
easier for you to contribute workflows and scripts to the community. For more information,
see the following blogs: You must register an account in the PowerShell Gallery before you can publish packages to
the Gallery. This is because publishing packages requires a NuGetApiKey, which is provided
upon registration. To register, use your personal, work, or school account to sign in to
the PowerShell Gallery. A one-time registration process is required when you sign in for
the first time. Afterwards, your NuGetApiKey is available on your profile page. Once you have registered in the Gallery, use thePublish-ModuleorPublish-Scriptcmdlets to publish your package to the
Gallery. For more details on how to run these cmdlets, visit the Publish tab, or read thePublish-ModuleandPublish-Scriptdocumentation. You do not need to register or sign in to the Gallery to install or save packages. The full error message is: ""Failed to process request."" 'The specified API key is invalid
or does not have permission to access the specified package.'. The remote server returned
an error: (403) Forbidden."" This error can occur for the following reasons: Please be aware that your gallery account does not accommodate changes to your primary
email alias. For more information, seeMicrosoft Email Aliases. By selecting a Category checkbox, you are stating ""I would like to see all packages in
this category."" Only the packages in the selected categories will be displayed. So
similarly, by selecting all the Category checkboxes, you are stating ""I would like to see
all packages in any category."" But some packages in the gallery do not belong to any of
the categories listed, so they will not appear in the results. To see all packages in the
gallery, uncheck all the Categories, or select the packages tab again. Any kind of PowerShell module (script modules, binary modules, or manifest modules) can be
published to the gallery. To publish a module, PowerShellGet needs to know a few things
about it - the version, description, author, and how it is licensed. This information is
read as part of the publishing process from themodule manifest(.psd1) file, or from
the value of thePublish-Modulecmdlet'sLicenseUriparameter. All modules published to the Gallery must have module manifests.
Any module that includes the following information in its manifest can be published to the
Gallery: The easiest way to create a module manifest is to run theNew-ModuleManifestcmdlet. In
PowerShell 5.0 or newer, New-ModuleManifest generates a correctly-formatted module
manifest with blank fields for useful metadata likeProjectUri,LicenseUri, andTags. Simply fill in the blanks, or use the generated manifest as an example of
correct formatting. To verify that all required metadata fields have been properly filled, use theTest-ModuleManifestcmdlet. To update the module manifest file fields, use theUpdate-ModuleManifestcmdlet. Any kind of PowerShell script (scripts or workflows) can be published to the gallery. To
publish a script, PowerShellGet needs to know a few things about it - the version,
description, author, and how it is licensed. This information is read as part of the
publishing process from the script file'sPSScriptInfosection, or from the value of thePublish-Scriptcmdlet'sLicenseUriparameter. All
scripts published to the Gallery must have metadata information. Any script that includes
the following information in its PSScriptInfo section can be published to the Gallery: Type what you are looking for in the text box. For example, if you want to find modules
that are related to Azure SQL, just type ""azure sql"". Our search engine will look for
those keywords in all published packages, including titles, descriptions and across
metadata. Then, based on a weighted quality score, it will display the closest matches.
You can also search by specific field using field:""value"" syntax in the search query for
the following fields: So, for example, when you search for PowerShellVersion:""2.0"" only results that are
compatible with PowerShellVersion 2.0 (based on their module/script manifest) will be
displayed. The easiest way to create a properly-formatted script file is to run theNew-ScriptFileInfocmdlet. In PowerShell 5.0,
New-ScriptFileInfo generates a correctly-formatted script file with blank fields for
useful metadata likeProjectUri,LicenseUri, andTags. Simply fill in the
blanks, or use the generated script file as an example of correct formatting. To verify that all required metadata fields have been properly filled, use theTest-ScriptFileInfocmdlet. To update the script metadata fields, use theUpdate-ScriptFileInfocmdlet. The term PowerShell module also refers to the files that implement actual functionality.
Script module files (.psm1) contain PowerShell code. Binary module files (.dll) contain
compiled code. Here is one way to think about it: the folder that encapsulates the module is the module
folder. The module folder can contain a module manifest (.psd1) that describes the
contents of the folder. The files that actually do the work are the script module files
(.psm1) and the binary module files (.dll). DSC resources are located in a specific
sub-folder, and are implemented as script module files or binary module files. All of the modules in the Gallery contain module manifests, and most of these modules
contain script module files or binary module files. The term module can be confusing
because of these different meanings. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, all uses of the
word module on this page refer to the module folder containing these files. PackageManagement is a common interface for working with any package manager. Eventually,
whether you're dealing with PowerShell modules, MSIs, Ruby gems, NuGet packages, or Perl
modules, you should be able to use PackageManagement's commands (Find-Package and
Install-Package) to find and install them. PackageManagement does this by having a package
provider for each package manager that plugs into PackageManagement. Providers do all of
the actual work; they fetch content from repositories, and install the content locally.
Often, package providers simply wrap around the existing package manager tools for a given
package type. PowerShellGet is the package manager for PowerShell packages. There is a PSModule package
provider that exposes PowerShellGet functionality through PackageManagement. Because of
this, you can either runInstall-ModuleorInstall-Package -Provider PSModuleto install a module from the PowerShell Gallery.
Certain PowerShellGet functionality, includingUpdate-ModuleandPublish-Module, cannot be accessed through
PackageManagement commands. In summary, PowerShellGet is solely focused on having a premium package management
experience for PowerShell content. PackageManagement is focused on exposing all package
management experiences through one general set of tools. If you find this answer
unsatisfying, there is a long answer at the bottom of this document, in theHow does
PackageManagement actually relate to PowerShellGet?section. For more information, please visit thePackageManagement project page. The PowerShell Gallery is a modified version of theNuGet Gallery. PowerShellGet uses NuGet provider to work with
NuGet based repositories like the PowerShell Gallery. You can use PowerShellGet against any valid NuGet repository or file share. You simply
need to add the repository by running theRegister-PSRepositorycmdlet. Yes. Under the hood, PowerShellGet heavily leverages PackageManagement infrastructure. At the PowerShell cmdlet layer,Install-Moduleis
actually a thin wrapper aroundInstall-Package -Provider PSModule. At the PackageManagement package provider layer, the PSModule package provider actually
calls into other PackageManagement package providers. For example, when you are working
with NuGet-based galleries (such as the PowerShell Gallery), the PSModule package provider
uses the NuGet Package Provider to work with the repository.  Figure 1: PowerShellGet Architecture In general we recommend picking the latest version of PowerShellGet module (note that it
requires .NET 4.5). ThePowerShellGetmodule requiresPowerShell 3.0 or newer. Therefore,PowerShellGetrequires one of the following operating systems: PowerShellGetalso requires .NET Framework 4.5 or above. For more information, seeInstall the .NET Framework for developers. It is not possible to squat package names. If you feel that an existing package has taken
the name which suits your package more, trycontacting the owner of the package.
If you didn't get response within a couple of weeks, you can contact support and the
PowerShell Gallery team will look in to it. Check outManaging Package Owners on PowerShellGallery.comfor details. We encourage the PowerShell community to work together to resolve any disputes that may
arise between package owners and the owners of other packages. We have crafted adispute resolution processthat we ask
you to follow before PowerShellGallery.com administrators intercede. Frequently asked questions about the PowerShell Gallery In this article What is a PowerShell module? What is a PowerShell script?

The following topics are covered: Azure Maps is built with the collaboration of world-class mobility and location technology partners, including AccuWeather, who provides the underlying weather data. To read the announcement of Azure Map's collaboration with AccuWeather, seeRain or shine: Azure Maps Weather Services will bring insights to your enterprise. AccuWeather has real-time weather and environmental information available anywhere in the world, largely because of their partnerships with many governmental weather agencies and other proprietary arrangements. A list of this foundational information is provided below. Tens of thousands of surface observations, along with other data, are incorporated to create and influence the current conditions made available to users. These surface observations include not only freely available standard datasets, but also unique observations obtained from meteorological services in many countries/regions, such as India, Brazil, Canada, and other proprietary inputs. These unique datasets increase the spatial and temporal resolution of current condition data for our users. These datasets are reviewed in real time for accuracy for the Digital Forecast System, which uses AccuWeatherâ€™s proprietary artificial intelligence algorithms to continuously modify the forecasts, ensuring they always incorporate the latest data and, in that way, maximize their continual accuracy. Many weather forecast guidance systems are used to formulate global forecasts. Over 150 numerical forecast models are used each day, both external and internal datasets. These models include government models such as the European Centre ECMWF and the U.S. Global Forecast System (GFS). Also, AccuWeather incorporates proprietary high-resolution models that downscale forecasts to specific locations and strategic regional domains to predict weather with further accuracy. AccuWeatherâ€™s unique blending and weighting algorithms   have been developed over the last several decades. These algorithms optimally apply the many forecast inputs to provide highly accurate forecasts. Weather service coverage varies by country/region. All features aren't available in every country/region. For more information, seecoverage documentation. Current Conditions data is updated at least once an hour, but can be updated more frequently with rapidly changing conditions â€“ such as large temperature changes, sky conditions changes, precipitation changes, and so on. Most observation stations around the world report many times per hour as conditions change. However, a few areas will still only update once, twice, or four times an hour at scheduled intervals. Azure Maps caches the Current Conditions data for up to 10 minutes to help capture the near real-time update frequency of the data as it occurs. To see when the cached response expires and avoid displaying outdated data, you can use the Expires Header information in the HTTP header of the Azure Maps API response. Daily and Hourly Forecast data is updated multiple times per day, as updated observations are received.  For example, if a forecasted high/low temperature is surpassed, our Forecast data will adjust at the next update cycle. Updates happen at different intervals but typically happens within an hour. Many sudden weather conditions may cause a forecast data change. For example, on a hot summer afternoon, an isolated thunderstorm might suddenly emerge, bringing heavy cloud coverage and rain. The isolated storm could effectively drop temperature by as much as 10 degrees. This new temperature value will impact the Hourly and Daily Forecasts for the rest of the day, and as such, will be updated in our datasets. Azure Maps Forecast APIs are cached for up to 30 mins. To see when the cached response expires and avoid displaying outdated data, you can look at the Expires Header information in the HTTP header of the Azure Maps API response. We recommend updating as necessary based on a specific product use case and UI (user interface). The Azure Maps Web SDK provides a services module. The services module is a helper library that makes it easy to use the Azure Maps REST services in web or Node.js applications. by using JavaScript or TypeScript. To get started, see ourdocumentation. The Azure Maps Android SDKs supports Mercator tile layers, which can have x/y/zoom notation, quad key notation, or EPSG 3857 bounding box notation. The Azure Maps Native SDK for Android is now deprecated and will be retired on 3/31/25. To avoid service disruptions, migrate to the Azure Maps Web SDK by 3/31/25. For more information, seeThe Azure Maps Android SDK migration guide. Yes. To learn how to migrate radar and infrared satellite tiles to the Microsoft Power BI visual, seeAdd a tile layer to Power BI visual. The Azure MapsWeather concept articleincludes a guide to help interpret colors used for radar and satellite tiles. The article covers color samples and HEX color codes. Yes. In addition to real-time radar and satellite tiles, Azure Maps customers can request past and future tiles to enhance data visualizations with map overlays. Customers can call the Get Map Tile v2 API or request tiles via Azure Maps web SDK. Radar tiles are available for up to 1.5 hours in the past, and for up to 2 hours in the future. The tiles are available in 5-minute intervals. Infrared tiles are provided for up to 3 hours in the past, and are available in 10-minute intervals.

General questions: Setup questions: Questions about using Windows Update for Business reports: Delivery Optimization data: Windows Update for Business reports is a cloud-based solution that provides information about your Microsoft Entra joined devices' compliance with Windows updates. Windows Update for Business reports is offered through theAzure portal, and it's included as part of the Windows 10 or Windows 11 prerequisite licenses. Data ingested into your Log Analytics workspace can be retained at no charge for up to first 31 days (or 90 days ifMicrosoft Sentinelis enabled on the workspace). Data ingested intoApplication Insights, either classic or workspace-based, is retained for 90 days without any charge.
Data retained beyond these no-charge periods are charged for each GB of data retained for a month, pro-rated daily. For more information, seeLog Data RetentioninAzure Monitor pricing. Windows Update for Business reports supports clients running asupported version of Windows 10 or Windows 11Professional, Education, Enterprise, and Enterprise multi-session editions. Windows Update for Business reports only provides data for the standard Desktop Windows client version and isn't currently compatible with Windows Server, Surface Hub, IoT, or other versions. Important Currently there is a known issue where Windows Update for Business reports doesn't display data for Enterprise multi-session edition devices. After verifying theprerequisitesare met, you can start to set up Windows Update for Business reports.
The two main steps for setting up  Windows Update for Business reports are: Typically, theWaiting for Windows Update for Business reports datamessage is displayed because: A400 Bad Request: The specified resource already existserror message indicates that the service already has a subscription and workspace mapping saved. If you're trying to re-enroll with the same configuration settings, wait a few minutes, then refresh the page before saving your subscription and workspace again. Sometimes it can take time to register the save, so it's important to not re-enroll too quickly. If you're seeing the device ID but not the device name, it's possible that the required policy for displaying the device name isn't set on the client. Ensure clients have the policy configured. Here are some reasons why you may not be seeing devices in reports: Devices have multiple records when theUCClientUpdateStatusorUCClientServiceStatustables are queried. These tables contain multiple records because they have the history for all devices that have discovered applicable updates within the past 28 days. For example, it's possible that a device has discovered multiple security updates, each with different update states, at various times over the past 28 days. It's also possible that a device can be in multiple deployments, so multiple records are displayed. An unknown client state is displayed if there isn't an update record for the device. This state can happen for many reasons, like the device not being active, not being able to scan Windows Update, or it doesn't currently have any update related activity occurring. The wordtargetin data labels refers to the update version, build, or KB the client intends to update to. Typically, the fields starting withOS, such as OSbuild and OSversion, represents what the device is currently running. These tables can be used for the following information: UCClient: Represents an individual device's record. It contains data such as the device's name, currently installed build, and the OS Edition. Each device has one record in this table. Use this table to get the overall compliance status of your devices. UCClientUpdateStatus: Contains records for every update the device determined was applicable. There can be multiple records for a device if it's discovered multiple applicable updates in the past 60 days. Use this table if you want to get detailed update status for your active deployments. There will typically be 3 update status records per device for the latest 3 security updates. UCUpdateAlert: Use this table to understand update failures and act on devices through alert recommendations. This table contains information that needs attention, relative to one device, one update, and one deployment (if relevant). Windows quality updates are monthly updates that arereleased on the second or fourth Tuesday of the month. The cumulative updates released on the second Tuesday of the month can contain both security updates and nonsecurity updates. Cumulative updates released on the fourth Tuesday of the month are optional nonsecurity preview releases. Use the fields within theUCClient tablefor additional information, such as: Once enrollment is done and devices are properly configured to share data, wait for 48 hours for data to start showing up in reports. It can take up to 14 days for all of your devices to show up in reports in some cases where devices aren't active much. You can check to see if the Log Analytics tables are being populated in your workspace. The data is ingested by the service daily to generate reports. If you notice a day is missing, it's possible that the reports service missed an ingestion. To confirm devices are sending data,querytheUCClient table.

Data is aggregated for the last 28 days for active devices. You may see data in the report listed as 'Unknown'. This status indicates that the Delivery Optimization DownloadMode setting is either invalid or empty. The top groups are represented by the number of devices in a particular group, for any of the four group types (GroupID, City, Country, and ISP). The GroupID values are encoded for data protection requirements. For more information, seeMapping GroupIDs. Today, we don't have a distinction for data that was downloaded by location. A row in UCDOStatus represents data downloaded by a combination of a single device ID (AzureADDeviceId) by content type (ContentType). A row in UCDOAggregatedStatus represents data summarized at the tenant level (AzureADTenantID) for each content type (ContentType). If there's a Connected Cache server at the ISP level, BytesFromCache filters out any bytes coming the ISP's Connected Cache. Delivery Optimization PowerShell cmdletscan be a powerful tool used to monitor Delivery Optimization data on the device. These cmdlets use the cache on the device. The data calculated in the report is taken from the Delivery Optimization events. The data in the report does represent the last 28 days of data. The query for last seven days is just to get the data for the latest snapshot from past seven days. It's possible that data is delayed for sometime and not available for current day, so we look for past seven day snapshot in log analytics and show the latest snapshot.

Private offers let you transact private deals with your customers in the commercial marketplace. This new feature supports many new capabilities and addresses limitations associated with private plans. You can use it to:  * Requires a publicly transactable offer in the marketplace. You can create private offers for all transactable offer types: SaaS, Azure VM, Azure container and Azure application. Private offers aren't currently available in Microsoft AppSource. On thePrivate offersdashboard, you can: To offer your employees free access to your products by using the marketplace: After you finish these steps, Microsoft charges only the infrastructure cost for any usage or subscription on that billing account. To create a private offer, you need the billing account ID of your customer. Billing account information is available only to customers. Publishers can't access it. Customers can find the billing account information in the Azure portal by going toCost Management + Billing>Settings>Properties. Or, if a customer knows the subscription that they plan to use for the purchase, they can find their billing account information in the Azure portal by selectingSubscriptions, selecting the relevant subscription, and then going toProperties(orBilling Properties). To access this information, the customer must be an owner or contributor on the billing account. If a customer doesn't have a billing account, they can create one by signing up on Azure.com. SeeBilling account scopes in the Azure portal. With the private offer applied at the level of the billing account ID, if new subscriptions are added to the customer's Azure plan, the private offer automatically applies to those subscriptions. You don't need to make edits to the private offer. While you're creating a new private offer, selectAccepted dateas the start date to make the price available for the customer to transact as soon as the private offer is accepted. ChooseSpecific monthto make the private price available in a future calendar month. For example: If you create a private offer on May 15 and want the private price to be available to the customer on June 1, selectJune. The private offer starts on the first day of the month and ends on the last day. You can't select specific start and end dates. If the customer purchases the public offer or plan before June 1, they won't receive the private offer price for any transactions before June 1. The time zone for the start date is Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Note If a private offer is extended to an existing customer of pay-as-you-go consumption-based products like virtual machines, selectingAccepted datemakes the private price applicable for the entire month. For example: If you create a private offer on May 15 for a virtual machine product and selectAccepted date, the private price will apply for the entire month of acceptance. TheAccept bydate is the private offer's expiration date. Your customer must accept the private offer before the end of this date or the private offer expires.End datespecifies the date on which the private price and terms end. The time zone for the accept-by date and the end date is UTC. You can document and upload custom terms and conditions that you and the customer agreed upon as part of the private deal. The customer is required to legally accept these terms and conditions as part of accepting the private offer. Uploading custom terms and conditions is optional in a private offer. You can upload only one document, and it must be in PDF format. Custom terms and conditions between you and the customer shouldn't violate any terms in the Microsoft Publisher Agreement. It depends. If you want to use the public terms of use for the private offer with no changes, you can skip uploading any custom terms and conditions to the private offer. Public terms of use are presented to the customer during purchase of the private offer. If you want to amend the public terms for the private offer, you need to upload custom terms and conditions to the private offer. Custom terms and conditions are presented to the customer during purchase of the private offer. You can use a discounted price to provide a percentage-based discount on top of a publicly listed plan. You can specify a discounted price only when the private price is lower than the publicly listed plan price. You can use an absolute price to specify a price point that's higher, lower, or equal to the publicly listed plan price. You can apply an absolute price only at a plan level. You can't apply an absolute price for VM offer types or any plans that have a trial enabled. The clone option creates an editable copy of an existing private offer that you can publish as a new private offer. You can use cloning on any private offer, regardless of its status. You can upgrade an existing private offer that a customer accepted. The marketplace supports upgrades only at renewal. For example, the upgraded offer's start and end date can't overlap with the existing private offer. You can edit only pricing, dates, terms, and notification contacts for the upgraded private offer. If you need other changes, create a new private offer. You can't change a private offer in aPending Acceptancestate. If the customer hasn't accepted the private offer, you can withdraw the offer from the customer to make changes. After you withdraw a private offer, your customer can't access it unless you resubmit it to the customer. Private offers created undercustomize pricing for existing public offers and plansmust be unique and not overlap with another customer private offer or multiparty private offer for the same customer billing account ID, using the same base public plan, with overlapping private offer start and end dates. Overlapping private offers are blocked at submission in Partner Center. To remedy this conflict, you have several options depending on whether the customer has already accepted the private offer.  Note For private offers published before 2025 with the same customer billing account ID, same product plan(s), and overlapping private offer start and end dates, the price is determined as follows: Partner Center uses theNotification Contactsinformation to notify you of changes to the private offer status. The notification email is sent when the private offer status changes fromIn ProgresstoPending Acceptance,Pending AcceptancetoAccepted, orPending AcceptancetoExpired. No, Microsoft doesn't send any notifications to the customer. You should copy the private offer link and send it to the customer for acceptance. No. You're notified via the SaaS fulfillment API that a SaaS offer is activated but not that it has an associated private offer. You can see if the customer accepted a private offer in theInsightsreporting. You can't upgrade a private offer during the offer's term. You can create an upgrade at any time and a customer could accept it, but the upgrade takes effect only at the end of the existing private offer. Use theUpgradefeature to extend the start and end date and to include revised custom terms and conditions associated with the private offer. To add or remove offers and plans, create a new private offer. Any user within the customer's organization can see the details of a private offer. To accept a private offer, the user in the customer organization needs to be an owner, contributor, or admin on the billing account. Without appropriate permissions, the user can't accept the private offer. To get access to the billing account, the user should contact the admin or owner. A red notice at the top of the page indicates three people in the customer's organization who have the appropriate permissions. After a private offer is accepted, it's a legal agreement between you and the customer, so it can't be changed. If the private offer is due to begin on the accepted date, the customer can go to the Azure portal to subscribe to the offer by using any Azure subscription associated with the billing account. The customer must use an Azure subscription associated with the configured billing account to get the private price. If the private offer includes pay-as-you-go offers (virtual machines) and was extended to an existing customer, the customer is charged at the private price as soon as the private offer is accepted. For a private offer that includes SaaS, the customer must subscribe to the SaaS product and then configure the product within 30 days of subscribing to it. If you configured the private offer to begin at a future date, your customer could accept the private offer before the accept-by date but should not complete the purchase until after the private offer's start date. After the customer accepts the private offer, it can take up to 15 minutes for the private price to appear in the marketplace on the product details page. If the customer transacts within these 15 minutes, the marketplace still charges the customer correctly by using the private price. Accepting a private offer doesn't initiate billing. To complete the purchase, customers must subscribe to the SaaS product or deploy the virtual machine or Azure application product within the private offer in the Azure portal. For a private offer that includes a SaaS product, the customer must also configure the product within 30 days of subscribing to it. If the customer chose automatic renewal, and you don't create a new private offer that the customer accepts, the customer is charged the list price of the public plan. Yes. Customers who have a Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment can decrement it for benefit-eligible purchases through customer private offers. Customers can't decrement their Azure Consumption Commitment for product purchases through CSP private offers. There are no changes in the payout experience for private offers. After a customer transacts by using private offers, the transaction details appear on theEarningspage in Partner Center. In theInsightsworkspace, you can filter theOrdersandUsagereports by private offers and public offers. You should use private offers for your negotiated deals on Azure Marketplace. Private plans continue to be supported and can be used for specific scenarios. For example, you can use a private plan if you want to use a private (custom) VM image for your customer as part of the private deal or if it meets requirements for their specific use case. To use private offers, ISVs must have publicly transactable plans published to Azure Marketplace. We don't recommend that you have both a private plan and a private offer for the same customer, product, and time period. Private plans can continue to exist for existing deals, and you can use private offers for new deals. Move customers to private offers as each customer's private plan term comes up for renewal or expiration. You can create a private offer that will begin at the end of the current subscription term for the private plan. After your customers accept the private offer, they need to subscribe to the plan that your private offer contains. You can also move your customers to private offers in the middle of a private plan term. If a customer paid for the full term of the original private plan, create a private offer and set the customer price to $0 or apply a 100% discount to your retail price. Your customer then needs to accept the private offer terms and subscribe to the products within the private offer. Private offers support monthly, annual, two-year, or three-year terms. If your customer has a remaining duration that's different from these terms, it's best for the customer to complete the private plan term before subscribing to a private offer. For example, if your customer is in year two of a three-year private plan term and is due to pay for a third year, you can create a private offer for a one-year duration to charge the customer's final year via a private offer. Your customer then needs to cancel the original subscription to the private plan to avoid being charged as part of renewing the private plan. You can then stop-sell the private plan.

Can I modify an application proxy app from the **App registrations** page in the Microsoft Entra admin center?,"No, the following configuration items are being used by app proxy and shouldn't be altered or deleted:","Microsoft Entra ID is a cloud-based identity and access management solution. It's a directory and identity management service that operates in the cloud and offers authentication and authorization services to various Microsoft services, such as Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and Microsoft Azure. For more information, seeWhat is Microsoft Entra ID? To access the Microsoft Entra admin center or the Azure portal, each user needs permissions with a valid subscription. If you don't have a paid Microsoft 365 or Microsoft Entra subscription, you need to activate a freeMicrosoft Entra Accountor establish a paid subscription. All Azure subscriptions, whether paid or free, have a trust relationship with a Microsoft Entra tenant. All subscriptions rely on the Microsoft Entra tenant (directory) to authenticate and authorize security principals and devices. For more information, seeHow Azure subscriptions are associated with Microsoft Entra ID. Microsoft Entra ID provides you with common identity and access capabilities to all web services. Whether you're using Microsoft services, such as Microsoft 365, Power Platform, Dynamics 365, or other Microsoft products, you're already using Microsoft Entra ID to help turn on sign-on and access management for all cloud services. All users who are set up to use Microsoft services are defined as user accounts in one or more Microsoft Entra instances, providing these accounts access to Microsoft Entra ID. For more information, seeMicrosoft Entra ID Plans & Pricing Microsoft Entra paid services, such as Enterprise Mobility + Security (Microsoft Enterprise Mobility + Security) complement other Microsoft services like Microsoft 365, with comprehensive enterprise-scale development, management, and security solutions. For more information, see TheMicrosoft Cloud. By default, the person who signs up for a Microsoft Entra or Azure subscription is assigned the Owner role for Azure resources. An Owner can use either a Microsoft account or a work or school account from the directory that the Microsoft Entra or Azure subscription is associated with. This role is also authorized to manage services in the Azure portal. If others need to sign in and access services by using the same subscription, you can assign them the appropriatebuilt-in role. For more information, seeAssign Azure roles using the Azure portal. By default, the user who creates a Microsoft Entra tenant is automatically assigned theGlobal Administratorrole. This user has access to all Microsoft Entra directory features. Microsoft Entra ID has a different set of administrator roles to manage the directory and identity-related features. These administrators have access to various features in the Azure portal. The administrator's role determines what they can do, like create or edit users, assign administrative roles to others, reset user passwords, manage user licenses, or manage domains. For more information, seeAssign a user to administrator roles in Microsoft Entra IDandAssigning administrator roles in Microsoft Entra ID. No.  This isn't currently available. To optimize connectivity between your network and the Microsoft Entra admin center and its services, you might want to add specific Microsoft Entra admin center URLs to your allowlist. Doing so can improve performance and connectivity between your local- or wide area network. Network administrators often deploy proxy servers, firewalls, or other devices, which can help secure and give control over how users access the internet. Rules designed to protect users can sometimes block or slow down legitimate business-related internet traffic. This traffic includes communications between you and Microsoft Entra admin center over the following URLs: For more information, seeUsing Microsoft Entra application proxy to publish on-premises apps for remote users. Additional URLs that you should include are listed in the articleAllow the Azure portal URLs on your firewall or proxy server. You can usually leave an organization on your own without having to contact an administrator. However, in some cases this option isn't available and you need to contact your tenant admin, who can delete your account in the external organization. For more information, seeLeave an organization as an external user. You can connect your on-premises directory to Microsoft Entra ID by using Microsoft Entra Connect. For more information, seeIntegrating your on-premises identities with Microsoft Entra ID. You only need to set up single sign-on (SSO) between your on-premises directory and Microsoft Entra ID. As long as you access your cloud applications through Microsoft Entra ID, the service automatically drives your users to correctly authenticate with their on-premises credentials. Implementing SSO from on-premises can be easily achieved with federation solutions such as Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), or by configuring password hash sync.

Yes, if you have password write-back enabled, the password operations performed by an admin are written back to your on-premises environment. For more answers to password-related questions, seePassword management frequently asked questions. There are a couple of options. You can use the self-service password reset (SSPR) if it's available. Whether SSPR works depends on how it's configured.  For more information about resetting Microsoft Entra passwords, seeHow does the password reset portal work. For Microsoft 365 users, your admin can reset the password by using the steps outlined inReset user passwords. For Microsoft Entra accounts, admins can reset passwords by using one of the following: Microsoft Entra ID uses a more sophisticated strategy to lock accounts. This is based on the IP of the request and the passwords entered. The duration of the lockout also increases based on the likelihood that it's an attack. Rejected passwords return the message 'This password has been used too many times'. This refers to passwords that are globally common, such as any variants of ""Password"" and ""123456"". We do have a gateway that filters requests and provides some protection from botnets, and is applied for all B2C tenants. Microsoft Entra ID has more than 2,600 pre-integrated applications from Microsoft, application service providers, and partners. All pre-integrated applications support single sign-on (SSO). SSO lets you use your organizational credentials to access your apps. Some of the applications also support automated provisioning and de-provisioning.

It's a directory and identity management service that operates in the cloud and offers authentication and authorization services to various Microsoft services, such as Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and Microsoft Azure. For more information, seeWhat is Microsoft Entra ID? To access the Microsoft Entra admin center or the Azure portal, each user needs permissions with a valid subscription. If you don't have a paid Microsoft 365 or Microsoft Entra subscription, you need to activate a freeMicrosoft Entra Accountor establish a paid subscription. All Azure subscriptions, whether paid or free, have a trust relationship with a Microsoft Entra tenant. All subscriptions rely on the Microsoft Entra tenant (directory) to authenticate and authorize security principals and devices. For more information, seeHow Azure subscriptions are associated with Microsoft Entra ID. Microsoft Entra ID provides you with common identity and access capabilities to all web services. Whether you're using Microsoft services, such as Microsoft 365, Power Platform, Dynamics 365, or other Microsoft products, you're already using Microsoft Entra ID to help turn on sign-on and access management for all cloud services. All users who are set up to use Microsoft services are defined as user accounts in one or more Microsoft Entra instances, providing these accounts access to Microsoft Entra ID. For more information, seeMicrosoft Entra ID Plans & Pricing Microsoft Entra paid services, such as Enterprise Mobility + Security (Microsoft Enterprise Mobility + Security) complement other Microsoft services like Microsoft 365, with comprehensive enterprise-scale development, management, and security solutions. For more information, see TheMicrosoft Cloud. By default, the person who signs up for a Microsoft Entra or Azure subscription is assigned the Owner role for Azure resources. An Owner can use either a Microsoft account or a work or school account from the directory that the Microsoft Entra or Azure subscription is associated with. This role is also authorized to manage services in the Azure portal. If others need to sign in and access services by using the same subscription, you can assign them the appropriatebuilt-in role. For more information, seeAssign Azure roles using the Azure portal. By default, the user who creates a Microsoft Entra tenant is automatically assigned theGlobal Administratorrole. This user has access to all Microsoft Entra directory features. Microsoft Entra ID has a different set of administrator roles to manage the directory and identity-related features. These administrators have access to various features in the Azure portal. The administrator's role determines what they can do, like create or edit users, assign administrative roles to others, reset user passwords, manage user licenses, or manage domains. For more information, seeAssign a user to administrator roles in Microsoft Entra IDandAssigning administrator roles in Microsoft Entra ID. No.  This isn't currently available. To optimize connectivity between your network and the Microsoft Entra admin center and its services, you might want to add specific Microsoft Entra admin center URLs to your allowlist. Doing so can improve performance and connectivity between your local- or wide area network. Network administrators often deploy proxy servers, firewalls, or other devices, which can help secure and give control over how users access the internet. Rules designed to protect users can sometimes block or slow down legitimate business-related internet traffic. This traffic includes communications between you and Microsoft Entra admin center over the following URLs: For more information, seeUsing Microsoft Entra application proxy to publish on-premises apps for remote users. Additional URLs that you should include are listed in the articleAllow the Azure portal URLs on your firewall or proxy server. You can usually leave an organization on your own without having to contact an administrator. However, in some cases this option isn't available and you need to contact your tenant admin, who can delete your account in the external organization. For more information, seeLeave an organization as an external user. You can connect your on-premises directory to Microsoft Entra ID by using Microsoft Entra Connect. For more information, seeIntegrating your on-premises identities with Microsoft Entra ID. You only need to set up single sign-on (SSO) between your on-premises directory and Microsoft Entra ID. As long as you access your cloud applications through Microsoft Entra ID, the service automatically drives your users to correctly authenticate with their on-premises credentials. Implementing SSO from on-premises can be easily achieved with federation solutions such as Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), or by configuring password hash sync. You can easily deploy both options by using the Microsoft Entra Connect configuration wizard. For more information, seeIntegrating your on-premises identities with Microsoft Entra ID. Yes, Microsoft Entra ID provides you with theMicrosoft Entra ID Access Panelfor user self-service and application access.

Can I Change the Logon User of the Microsoft Entra Private Network Connector / Updater Services?,Changing the logon user of the connector or updater service is not supported. Correct Configuration: Microsoft Entra Private Network Connector:Network ServiceMicrosoft Entra Private Network Connector Updater:NT Authority\System,"This article addresses frequently asked questions about Microsoft Entra pass-through authentication. Keep checking back for updated content. Reviewthis guidefor a comparison of the various Microsoft Entra sign-in methods and how to choose the right sign-in method for your organization. Pass-through Authentication is a free feature. You don't need any paid editions of Microsoft Entra ID to use it. Yes. AllConditional Accesscapabilities, including Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication, work with Pass-through Authentication. Yes, both pass-through authentication (PTA) and password hash sync (PHS) support sign-in using a non-UPN value, such as an alternate email. For more information aboutAlternate Sign-in ID. No. Pass-through Authenticationdoesn'tautomatically failover to password hash synchronization. To avoid user sign-in failures, you should configure Pass-through Authentication forhigh availability. When you use Microsoft Entra Connect to switch the sign-in method from password hash synchronization to Pass-through Authentication, Pass-through Authentication becomes the primary sign-in method for your users in managed domains. All users' password hashes that are previously synchronized by password hash synchronization remain stored on Microsoft Entra ID. Yes. The rebranded versions of the Pass-through Authentication Agent, version 1.5.193.0 or later, support this configuration. For this feature to work, you need version 1.1.750.0 or later for Microsoft Entra Connect and 1.5.193.0 or later for the Pass-through Authentication Agent. Install all the software on servers with Windows Server 2012 R2 or later. This may be due to either the updater service not working correctly or if there are no new updates available that the service can install.
The updater service is healthy if itâ€™s running and there are no errors recorded in the event log (Applications and Services logs -> Microsoft -> AzureADConnect-Agent -> Updater -> Admin). Only major versions are released for auto upgrade. We recommend updating your Agent manually only if it's necessary. For example, you can't wait for a major release, because you must fix a known problem or you want to use a new feature. For more information on new releases, the type of the release (download, auto upgrade), bug fixes, and new features see,Microsoft Entra pass-through authentication agent: Version release history. To manually upgrade a connector: If you've configuredpassword writebackfor a specific user, and if the user signs in by using Pass-through Authentication, they can change or reset their passwords. The passwords are written back to on-premises Active Directory as expected. If you haven't configured password writeback for a specific user or if the user doesn't have a valid Microsoft Entra ID license assigned, the user can't update their password in the cloud. They can't update their password, even if their password expired. The user instead sees this message: ""Your organization doesn't allow you to update your password on this site. Update it according to the method recommended by your organization, or ask your admin if you need help."" The user or the administrator must reset their password in on-premises Active Directory. The password expiry doesn't trigger the revocation of authentication tokens or cookies. Until the tokens or cookies are valid, the user is able to use them. This applies regardless of the authentication type (PTA, PHS, and federated scenarios). For more details please check the following documentation: Microsoft identity platform access tokens - Microsoft identity platform | Microsoft Docs Read information about Smart Lockout. The Authentication Agents make HTTPS requests over port 443 for all feature operations. The Authentication Agents make HTTP requests over port 80 to download the TLS/SSL certificate revocation lists (CRLs). Note Recent updates reduced the number of ports that the feature requires. If you have older versions of Microsoft Entra Connect or the Authentication Agent, keep these ports open as well: 5671, 8080, 9090, 9091, 9350, 9352, and 10100-10120. Yes. If Web Proxy Auto-Discovery (WPAD) is enabled in your on-premises environment, Authentication Agents automatically attempt to locate and use a web proxy server on the network. For more information about using the outbound proxy server, seeWork with existing on-premises proxy servers. If you don't have WPAD in your environment, you can add proxy information to allow a Pass-through Authentication Agent to communicate with Microsoft Entra ID: No, you can only install one Pass-through Authentication Agent on a single server. If you want to configure Pass-through Authentication for high availability,follow the instructions here. The communication between each Pass-through Authentication Agent and Microsoft Entra ID is secured using certificate-based authentication. Thesecertificates are automatically renewed every few months by Microsoft Entra ID. There's no need to manually renew these certificates. You can clean up older expired certificates as required. As long as a Pass-through Authentication Agent is running, it remains active and continually handles user sign-in requests. If you want to uninstall an Authentication Agent, go toControl Panel -> Programs -> Programs and Features. Uninstall both theMicrosoft Entra Connect Authentication Agentand theMicrosoft Entra Connect Agent Updaterprograms. If you check the Pass-through Authentication blade on theMicrosoft Entra admin centeras at least aHybrid Identity Administrator. You should see the Authentication Agent showing asInactive. This isexpected. The Authentication Agent is automatically dropped from the list after 10 days. If you're migrating from AD FS (or other federation technologies) to Pass-through Authentication, we highly recommend that you follow ourquickstart guide. Yes. Multi-forest environments are supported if there are forest trusts (two-way) between your Active Directory forests and if name suffix routing is correctly configured. No, installing multiple Pass-through Authentication Agents ensures onlyhigh availability. It doesn't provide deterministic load balancing between the Authentication Agents. Any Authentication Agent (at random) can process a particular user sign-in request. Installing multiple Pass-through Authentication Agents ensureshigh availability. But, it doesn't provide deterministic load balancing between the Authentication Agents. Consider the peak and average load of sign-in requests that you expect to see on your tenant. As a benchmark, a single Authentication Agent can handle 300 to 400 authentications per second on a standard 4-core CPU, 16-GB RAM server. To estimate network traffic, use the following sizing guidance: For most customers, two or three Authentication Agents in total are sufficient for high availability and capacity. However, in production environments, we recommend that you have a minimum of 3 Authentication Agents running on your tenant. You should install Authentication Agents close to your domain controllers to improve sign-in latency. Note There's a system limit of 40 Authentication Agents per tenant. It's recommended that you enable or disable Pass-through Authentication using aHybrid Identity Administratoraccount. Doing it this way ensures that you don't get locked out of your tenant.
] Rerun the Microsoft Entra Connect wizard and change the user sign-in method from Pass-through Authentication to another method. This change disables Pass-through Authentication on the tenant and uninstalls the Authentication Agent from the server. You must manually uninstall the Authentication Agents from the other servers. If you uninstall a Pass-through Authentication Agent from a server, it causes the server to stop accepting sign-in requests. To avoid breaking the user sign-in capability on your tenant, ensure that you have another Authentication Agent running before you uninstall a Pass-through Authentication Agent. Under the following circumstances your on-premises UPN changes might not synchronize if: This is because the default behavior of tenants created prior to June 15, 2015 was to block UPN changes. If you need to un-block UPN changes you need to run the following PowerShell cmdlet. Get the ID by using theGet-MgDirectoryOnPremiseSynchronizationcmdlet. Tenants created after June 15, 2015 have the default behavior of synchronizing UPN changes. To validate which local server or authentication agent was used for a specific sign-in event: In theMicrosoft Entra admin center, go to the sign-in event. SelectAuthentication Details. In theAuthentication Method Detailcolumn, Agent ID details are shown in the format ""Pass-through Authentication; PTA AgentId: 00001111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-3333cccc4444"". To get Agent ID details for the agent that's installed on your local server, sign-in to your local server and run following cmdlet: Get-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Azure AD Connect Agents\Azure AD Connect Authentication Agent' | Select *Instance* The GUID value that's returned is the Agent ID of the authentication agent that's installed on that specific server. If you have multiple agents in your environment, you can run this cmdlet on each agent server and capture the Agent ID details. Correlate the Agent ID that you get from the local server and from the Microsoft Entra sign-in logs to validate which agent or server acknowledged the sign-request. Microsoft Entra pass-through authentication: Frequently asked questions In this article Which of the methods to sign in to Microsoft Entra ID, Pass-through Authentication, password hash synchronization, and Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) should I choose? Is Pass-through Authentication a free feature? Does Conditional Access work with Pass-through Authentication? Does Pass-through Authentication support ""Alternate ID"" as the username, instead of ""userPrincipalName""? Does password hash synchronization act as a fallback to Pass-through Authentication? What happens when I switch from password hash synchronization to Pass-through Authentication? Can I install a Microsoft Entra private network connector on the same server as a Pass-through Authentication Agent? What versions of Microsoft Entra Connect and Pass-through Authentication Agent do you need? Why is my connector still using an older version and not automatically upgraded to latest version? What happens if my user's password expired and they try to sign in by using Pass-through Authentication? The user signs in to Microsoft Entra ID with credentials (username, password). In the meantime the userâ€™s password expires, but the user can still access Microsoft Entra resources. Why does this happen? How does Pass-through Authentication protect you against brute-force password attacks? What do Pass-through Authentication Agents communicate over ports 80 and 443? Can the Pass-through Authentication Agents communicate over an outbound web proxy server? Can I install two or more Pass-through Authentication Agents on the same server?

It's a directory and identity management service that operates in the cloud and offers authentication and authorization services to various Microsoft services, such as Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and Microsoft Azure. For more information, seeWhat is Microsoft Entra ID? To access the Microsoft Entra admin center or the Azure portal, each user needs permissions with a valid subscription. If you don't have a paid Microsoft 365 or Microsoft Entra subscription, you need to activate a freeMicrosoft Entra Accountor establish a paid subscription. All Azure subscriptions, whether paid or free, have a trust relationship with a Microsoft Entra tenant. All subscriptions rely on the Microsoft Entra tenant (directory) to authenticate and authorize security principals and devices. For more information, seeHow Azure subscriptions are associated with Microsoft Entra ID. Microsoft Entra ID provides you with common identity and access capabilities to all web services. Whether you're using Microsoft services, such as Microsoft 365, Power Platform, Dynamics 365, or other Microsoft products, you're already using Microsoft Entra ID to help turn on sign-on and access management for all cloud services. All users who are set up to use Microsoft services are defined as user accounts in one or more Microsoft Entra instances, providing these accounts access to Microsoft Entra ID. For more information, seeMicrosoft Entra ID Plans & Pricing Microsoft Entra paid services, such as Enterprise Mobility + Security (Microsoft Enterprise Mobility + Security) complement other Microsoft services like Microsoft 365, with comprehensive enterprise-scale development, management, and security solutions. For more information, see TheMicrosoft Cloud. By default, the person who signs up for a Microsoft Entra or Azure subscription is assigned the Owner role for Azure resources. An Owner can use either a Microsoft account or a work or school account from the directory that the Microsoft Entra or Azure subscription is associated with. This role is also authorized to manage services in the Azure portal. If others need to sign in and access services by using the same subscription, you can assign them the appropriatebuilt-in role. For more information, seeAssign Azure roles using the Azure portal. By default, the user who creates a Microsoft Entra tenant is automatically assigned theGlobal Administratorrole. This user has access to all Microsoft Entra directory features. Microsoft Entra ID has a different set of administrator roles to manage the directory and identity-related features. These administrators have access to various features in the Azure portal. The administrator's role determines what they can do, like create or edit users, assign administrative roles to others, reset user passwords, manage user licenses, or manage domains. For more information, seeAssign a user to administrator roles in Microsoft Entra IDandAssigning administrator roles in Microsoft Entra ID. No.  This isn't currently available. To optimize connectivity between your network and the Microsoft Entra admin center and its services, you might want to add specific Microsoft Entra admin center URLs to your allowlist. Doing so can improve performance and connectivity between your local- or wide area network. Network administrators often deploy proxy servers, firewalls, or other devices, which can help secure and give control over how users access the internet. Rules designed to protect users can sometimes block or slow down legitimate business-related internet traffic. This traffic includes communications between you and Microsoft Entra admin center over the following URLs: For more information, seeUsing Microsoft Entra application proxy to publish on-premises apps for remote users. Additional URLs that you should include are listed in the articleAllow the Azure portal URLs on your firewall or proxy server. You can usually leave an organization on your own without having to contact an administrator. However, in some cases this option isn't available and you need to contact your tenant admin, who can delete your account in the external organization. For more information, seeLeave an organization as an external user. You can connect your on-premises directory to Microsoft Entra ID by using Microsoft Entra Connect. For more information, seeIntegrating your on-premises identities with Microsoft Entra ID. You only need to set up single sign-on (SSO) between your on-premises directory and Microsoft Entra ID. As long as you access your cloud applications through Microsoft Entra ID, the service automatically drives your users to correctly authenticate with their on-premises credentials. Implementing SSO from on-premises can be easily achieved with federation solutions such as Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), or by configuring password hash sync. You can easily deploy both options by using the Microsoft Entra Connect configuration wizard. For more information, seeIntegrating your on-premises identities with Microsoft Entra ID. Yes, Microsoft Entra ID provides you with theMicrosoft Entra ID Access Panelfor user self-service and application access. If you're a Microsoft 365 customer, you can find many of the same capabilities in theOffice 365 portal. For more information, seeIntroduction to the Access Panel. Yes. The Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 edition provides you with Microsoft Entra Connect Health. Microsoft Entra Connect Health helps you monitor and gain insight into your on-premises identity infrastructure and the synchronization services. For more information, seeMonitor your on-premises identity infrastructure and synchronization services in the cloud. (For example, is it possible to use Microsoft Entra self-service password reset (SSPR) with password write-back and not store passwords in the cloud?) This example scenario doesn't require the on-premises password to be tracked in Microsoft Entra. This is because you don't need to synchronize your Active Directory passwords to Microsoft Entra ID to enable write-back. In a federated environment, Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) relies on the on-premises directory to authenticate the user. Password write-back operates in real time. For more information, seeGetting started with password management. Yes, if you have password write-back enabled, the password operations performed by an admin are written back to your on-premises environment. For more answers to password-related questions, seePassword management frequently asked questions. There are a couple of options. You can use the self-service password reset (SSPR) if it's available. Whether SSPR works depends on how it's configured.  For more information about resetting Microsoft Entra passwords, seeHow does the password reset portal work. For Microsoft 365 users, your admin can reset the password by using the steps outlined inReset user passwords. For Microsoft Entra accounts, admins can reset passwords by using one of the following: Microsoft Entra ID uses a more sophisticated strategy to lock accounts. This is based on the IP of the request and the passwords entered. The duration of the lockout also increases based on the likelihood that it's an attack. Rejected passwords return the message 'This password has been used too many times'. This refers to passwords that are globally common, such as any variants of ""Password"" and ""123456"". We do have a gateway that filters requests and provides some protection from botnets, and is applied for all B2C tenants. Microsoft Entra ID has more than 2,600 pre-integrated applications from Microsoft, application service providers, and partners. All pre-integrated applications support single sign-on (SSO). SSO lets you use your organizational credentials to access your apps. Some of the applications also support automated provisioning and de-provisioning. For a complete list of the pre-integrated applications, see theAzure Marketplace. With Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2, you can add and configure any application that you want. Depending on your application's capabilities and your preferences, you can configure SSO and automated provisioning. For more information, seeSingle sign-on SAML protocolandDevelop and plan provisioning for a SCIM endpoint. Microsoft Entra ID provides several ways for users to view and access their applications, such as: For more information, seeEnd user experiences for applications. Microsoft Entra ID supports many standardized protocols for authentication and authorization, such as SAML 2.0, OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, and WS-Federation.

I'm receiving an error about an invalid certificate or possible wrong password.,"After you uploaded the SSL certificate, you receive the message ""Invalid certificate, possible wrong password"" on the portal. Here are some tips for troubleshooting this error:","Windows 10 or newer devices that are Microsoft Entra hybrid joined don't show up underUSER devices.
Use theAll devicesview. You can also use a PowerShellGet-MgDevicecmdlet. Only the following devices are listed underUSER devices: Go toAll devices. Search for the device by using the device ID. Check the value under the join type column. Sometimes, the device might be reset or reimaged. So it's essential to also check the device registration state on the device: For troubleshooting information, see these articles: Windows clients fetch the PRT from Microsoft Entra ID if the user and the device belong to the same tenant. Users don't get a PRT for another tenant if the device isn't registered or the user isn't a member there. If the two tenants trust each other via B2B, you can always create cross tenant B2B access and trust device claims from your home tenant. The device join state, shown bydeviceID, must match the state on Microsoft Entra ID and meet any evaluation criteria for Conditional Access.
For more information, seeRequire managed devices for cloud app access with Conditional Access. On Windows 10/11 devices joined or registered with Microsoft Entra ID, users are issued aPrimary refresh token (PRT)which enables single sign-on. The validity of the PRT is based on the validity of the device itself. Users see this message if the device is either deleted or disabled in Microsoft Entra ID without initiating the action from the device itself. A device can be deleted or disabled in Microsoft Entra one of the following scenarios: This operation is by design. In this case, the device doesn't have access to resources in the cloud. Administrators can perform this action for stale, lost, or stolen devices to prevent unauthorized access. If this action was performed unintentionally, you need to re-enable or re-register the device using the steps that follow: If the device was disabled in Microsoft Entra ID, an administrator with sufficient privileges can enable it in the Microsoft Entra admin center. Note If you're syncing devices using Microsoft Entra Connect, Microsoft Entra hybrid joined devices will be automatically re-enabled during the next sync cycle. So, if you need to disable a Microsoft Entra hybrid joined device, you need to disable it from your on-premises AD. If the device is deleted in Microsoft Entra ID, you need to re-register the device. To re-register, you must take a manual action on the device. See the following steps for instructions to re-register based on the device state. To re-register Microsoft Entra hybrid joined Windows 10/11 and Windows Server 2016/2019 devices, take the following steps: For Microsoft Entra joined devices Windows 10/11 devices, take the following steps: For Microsoft Entra registered Windows 10/11 devices, take the following steps: Windows 10/11 device registration is only supported for FIPS-compliant TPM 2.0 and not supported for TPM 1.2. If your devices have FIPS-compliant TPM 1.2, you must disable them before proceeding with Microsoft Entra join or Microsoft Entra hybrid join. Microsoft doesn't provide any tools for disabling FIPS mode for TPMs as it is dependent on the TPM manufacturer. Contact your hardware OEM for support. It takes up to an hour for a revoke to be applied from the time the Microsoft Entra device is marked as disabled. Note For enrolled devices, we recommend that you wipe the device to make sure users can't access the resources. For more information, seeWhat is device enrollment?. Microsoft Entra ID added support for multiple Microsoft Entra accounts starting in Windows 10 1803 release. However, Windows 10/11 restricts the number of Microsoft Entra accounts on a device to 3 to limit the size of token requests and enable reliable single sign-on (SSO). Once three accounts are added, users see an error for subsequent accounts. The additional problem information on the error screen provides the following message indicating the reason - ""Add account operation is blocked because account limit is reached"". The Microsoft Entra Device Registration Service issues the MS-Organization-Access certificates during the device registration process. These certificates are issued to all join types supported on Windows - Microsoft Entra joined, Microsoft Entra hybrid joined and Microsoft Entra registered devices. Once issued, they're used as part of the authentication process from the device to request a Primary Refresh Token (PRT). For Microsoft Entra joined and Microsoft Entra hybrid joined devices, this certificate is present in Local Computer\Personal\Certificates whereas for Microsoft Entra registered devices, certificate is present in Current User\Personal\Certificates. All MS-Organization-Access certificates have a default lifetime of 10 years. These certificates are deleted from the corresponding certificate store when the device is unregistered from Microsoft Entra ID. Any inadvertent deletion of this certificate leads to authentication failures for the user, and requiring re-registration of the device in such cases. For pure Microsoft Entra joined devices, make sure you have an offline local administrator account or create one. You can't sign in with any Microsoft Entra user credentials. Next, go toSettings>Accounts>Access Work or School. Select your account and selectDisconnect. Follow the prompts and provide the local administrator credentials when prompted. Reboot the device to finish the unjoin process. Yes. Windows has a cached username and password capability that allows users who signed in previously to access the desktop quickly even without network connectivity. When a device is deleted or disabled in Microsoft Entra ID, it's not known to the Windows device. So users who signed in previously continue to access the desktop with the cached username and password. But as the device is deleted or disabled, users can't access any resources protected by device-based Conditional Access. Users who didn't sign in previously can't access the device. There's no cached username and password enabled for them. Yes, but only for a limited time. When a user is deleted or disabled in Microsoft Entra ID, it's not immediately known to the Windows device. So users who signed in previously can access the desktop with the cached username and password. Typically, the device is aware of the user state in less than four hours. Then Windows blocks those users' access to the desktop. As the user is deleted or disabled in Microsoft Entra ID, all their tokens are revoked. So they can't access any resources. Deleted or disabled users who didn't sign in previously can't access a device. There's no cached username and password enabled for them. No, currently, guest users can't sign in to a Microsoft Entra joined device. Organizations can choose todeploy Windows Server Hybrid Cloud Print with Pre-AuthenticationorUniversal Printfor their Microsoft Entra joined devices. SeeConnect to remote Microsoft Entra joined PC. Did you configure Conditional Access policies to require a specific device state? If the device doesn't meet the criteria, users are blocked, and they see that message.
Evaluate your Conditional Access policies. Make sure the device meets the criteria to avoid the message. Common reasons for this scenario are as follows: Currently, Microsoft Entra joined devices don't force users to change password on the lock screen. So, users with temporary or expired passwords will be forced to change passwords only when they access an application (that requires a Microsoft Entra token) after they log in to Windows. This error happens when you set up Microsoft Entra autoenrollment with Intune without proper license assigned. Make sure that the user who tries to Microsoft Entra join has the correct Intune license assigned. For more information, seeSet up enrollment for Windows devices. A likely cause is that you signed in to the device by using the local built-in administrator account.
Create a different local account before you use Microsoft Entra join to finish the setup. The P2P Server application is application registered by Microsoft Entra ID to enable Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections to any Microsoft Entra joined or Microsoft Entra hybrid joined Windows devices in your tenant. This application creates a tenant wide certificate issued by Microsoft Entra's certificate authority and is used to issue RDP device and user certificates for RDP connectivity. To ensure this is the correct application, you can find theObject IDof the P2P Server application in theMicrosoft Entra admin center>Applications>Enterprise Applications. Remove the default filter applied do you can see all applications. Compare thisObject IDusing the Microsoft Graph API to query for the details usingGET /servicePrincipals/{objectid}and confirm that the servicePrincipalNames property isurn:p2p_cert. Microsoft Entra ID issues the MS-Organization-P2P-Access certificates to Microsoft Entra joined and Microsoft Entra hybrid joined devices. These certificates are used to enable trust between devices in the same tenant for remote desktop scenarios. One certificate is issued to the device and another is issued to the user. The device certificate is present inLocal Computer\Personal\Certificatesand is valid for one day. This certificate is renewed (by issuing a new certificate) if the device is still active in Microsoft Entra ID. The user certificate isn't persistent and is valid for one hour, it's issued on-demand when a user attempts a remote desktop session to another Microsoft Entra joined device. It isn't renewed on expiry. Both these certificates are issued using the MS-Organization-P2P-Access certificate present in theLocal Computer\AAD Token Issuer\Certificates. Microsoft Entra ID issues this certificate during device registration. It isn't possible to disable or expire previous cached logons on Microsoft Entra joined devices. For Microsoft Entra hybrid joined devices, make sure to turn off automatic registration in AD using theControlled validationarticle. Then the scheduled task doesn't register the device again. Next, open a command prompt as an administrator and enterdsregcmd.exe /debug /leave. Or run this command as a script across several devices to unjoin in bulk. For troubleshooting information, see these articles: When your users add their accounts to apps on a domain-joined device, they might be prompted withAdd account to Windows?If they enterYeson the prompt, the device registers with Microsoft Entra ID. The trust type is marked as Microsoft Entra registered. After you enable Microsoft Entra hybrid join in your organization, the device also gets Microsoft Entra hybrid joined. Then two device states show up for the same device. In most cases, Microsoft Entra hybrid join takes precedence over the Microsoft Entra registered state, resulting in your device being considered Microsoft Entra hybrid joined for any authentication and Conditional Access evaluation. However, sometimes, this dual state can result in a nondeterministic evaluation of the device and cause access issues. We strongly recommend upgrading to Windows 10 version 1803 and above where we automatically clean up the Microsoft Entra registered state. Learn how toavoid or clean up this dual state on the Windows 10 machine. UPN changes are supported with Windows 10 2004 update and also applicable to Windows 11. Users on devices with this update won't have any issues after changing their UPNs. UPN changes on older versions of Windows 10 aren't fully supported with Microsoft Entra hybrid joined devices. While users can sign in to the device and access their on-premises applications, authentication with Microsoft Entra ID fails after a UPN change. As a result, users have SSO and Conditional Access issues on their devices. You need to unjoin the device from Microsoft Entra ID (run ""dsregcmd /leave"" with elevated privileges) and rejoin (happens automatically) to resolve the issue. No, except when the user's password is changed. After Windows 10/11 Microsoft Entra hybrid join is complete, and the user signs in at least once, the device doesn't require line of sight to the domain controller to access cloud resources. Windows 10/11 can get single sign-on to Microsoft Entra applications from anywhere with an internet connection, except when a password is changed. Users who sign in with Windows Hello for Business continue to get single sign-on to Microsoft Entra applications even after a password change, even if they don't have line of sight to their domain controller. If a password is changed outside the corporate network (for example, by using Microsoft Entra SSPR), then the user sign-in with the new password fails. For Microsoft Entra hybrid joined devices, on-premises Active Directory is the primary authority. When a device doesn't have line of sight to a domain controller, it's unable to validate the new password. The user needs to establish a connection with the domain controller (either via VPN or being in the corporate network) before they're able to sign in to the device with their new password. Otherwise, they can only sign in with their old password because of cached sign-in capability in Windows. Microsoft Entra invalidates the old password during token requests. This invalidation process prevents single sign-on and fails any device-based Conditional Access policies until the user authenticates with their new password in an app or browser. This issue doesn't occur if you use Microsoft Entra joined devices. For Windows 10 version 2004 and older, this process can be automated with theWorkplace Join (WPJ) removal tool. Note This tool removes all SSO accounts on the device. After this operation, all applications will lose SSO state, and the device will be unenrolled from management tools (MDM) and unregistered from the cloud. The next time an application tries to sign in, users will be asked to add the account again. Enable the following registry to block your users from adding other work accounts to your corporate domain joined, Microsoft Entra joined, or Microsoft Entra hybrid joined Windows 10/11 devices. This policy can also be used to block domain joined machines from inadvertently getting Microsoft Entra registered with the same user account.

"What is the length of the default and ""long"" backend timeout? Can the timeout be extended?","The default length is 85 seconds. The ""long"" setting is 180 seconds. The timeout limit can't be extended.","This article answers common questions about Azure Front Door features and functionality. If you don't see the answer to your question, you can contact us through the following channels (in escalating order): The comments section of this article. Azure Front Door Feedback. Microsoft Support:To create a new support request, in the Azure portal, on theHelptab, select theHelp + supportbutton, and then selectNew support request. Azure Front Door is a cloud-based service that delivers your applications faster and more reliably. It uses layer 7 load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple regions and endpoints. It also offers dynamic site acceleration (DSA) to optimize web performance and near real-time failover to ensure high availability. Azure Front Door is a fully managed service, so you don't have to worry about scaling or maintenance. Azure Front Door is a service that offers many benefits for your web applications, such as dynamic site acceleration (DSA), which improves the performance and user experience of your sites. Azure Front Door also handles TLS/SSL offloading and end to end TLS, which enhances the security and encryption of your web traffic. Additionally, Azure Front Door provides Web Application Firewall, cookie-based session affinity, url path-based routing, free certificates and multiple domain managements, and more. To learn more about the features and capabilities of Azure Front Door, seetier comparison. Azure Front Door and Azure Application Gateway are both load balancers for HTTP/HTTPS traffic, but they have different scopes. Front Door is a global service that can distribute requests across regions, while Application Gateway is a regional service that can balance requests within a region. Azure Front Door works with scale units, clusters or stamp units, while Azure Application Gateway works with VMs, containers or other resources in the same scale unit. Application Gateway behind Front Door is useful in these situations: Chaining two CDNs is generally not a recommended approach, it would work but comes with the following cons To use Azure Front Door, you must have a public VIP or a DNS name that is publicly accessible. Azure Front Door uses the public IP to route the traffic to your origin. A common scenario is to deploy an Azure Load Balancer behind Front Door. You can also use Private Link with Azure Front Door Premium to connect to an internal load balancer. For more information, seeenable Private Link with internal load balancer. Azure Front Door supports HTTP, HTTPS and HTTP/2. Azure Front Door supports HTTP/2 protocol for client connections. However, the backend pool communication uses HTTP/1.1 protocol. HTTP/2 support is on by default. You can use different types of origins for Azure Front Door, such as: The origin must have a public IP or a DNS hostname that can be resolved publicly. You can mix and match backends from different zones, regions, or even outside of Azure, as long as they're publicly accessible. Azure Front Door isn't limited to any Azure region, but operates globally. The only location you have to choose when you create a Front Door is the location of the resource group, which determines where the resource group's metadata get stored. The Front Door profile is a global resource and its configuration is distributed to all edge locations worldwide. For the complete list of points of presence (POPs) that provide global load balancing and content delivery for Azure Front Door, seeAzure Front Door POP locations. This list is updated regularly as new POPs are added or removed. You can also use the Azure Resource Manager API to query the current list of POPs programmatically. Azure Front Door is a service that distributes your application globally across multiple regions. It uses a common infrastructure that gets shared by all its customers, but you can customize your own Front Door profile to configure your application's specific requirements. Other customers' configurations can't affect your Front Door configuration, which is isolated from theirs. You can redirect host, path, and query string components of a URL with Azure Front Door. To learn how to configure URL redirection, refer toURL redirection. Front Door doesn't sort the routes for your web application. Instead, it chooses the route that best fits the request. To find out how Front Door matches requests to routes, seeHow Front Door matches requests to a routing rule. To ensure optimal performance of Front Door's features, you should only allow traffic that comes from Azure Front Door to reach your origin. As a result, unauthorized or malicious requests encounter the security and routing policies of Front Door and are denied access. To learn how to secure your origin, seeSecure traffic to Azure Front Door origins. The IP address of your Front Door's frontend anycast is fixed and might not change as long as you use the Front Door. However, the fixed IP address of your Front Door's frontend anycast isn't a guarantee. Avoid relying on the IP directly. Azure Front Door is a dynamic service that routes traffic to the best available backend. It doesn't offer static or dedicated frontend anycast IPs at this time. Yes. Refer to the MatchedRulesSetName property underAccess Logs. Yes. For more information, seeMicrosoft response to DDoS attacks against HTTP/2. Azure Front Door supports the X-Forwarded-For, X-Forwarded-Host, and X-Forwarded-Proto headers. These headers help Front Door identify the original client IP and protocol. If X-Forwarded-For is already present, Front Door adds the client socket IP to the end of the list. Otherwise, it creates the header with the client socket IP as the value. For X-Forwarded-Host and X-Forwarded-Proto, Front Door replaces the existing values with its own. For more information, seeFront Door supported HTTP headers. The deployment time for new Front Door configurations varies depending on the type of change. Typically, it takes between 3 and 20 minutes for the changes to propagate to all our edge locations worldwide. Note Custom TLS/SSL certificate updates might take longer, from several minutes up to an hour, to be deployed globally. Updates to routes or origin groups/backend pools are seamless and don't cause any downtime (assuming the new configuration is correct). Certificate updates are also done atomically, so there's no risk of outage. No. Currently, Azure Front Door only supports HTTP/1.1 from the edge to the origin. For gRPC to work, HTTP/2 is required. To use Azure Front Door Standard, Premium or (classic) tier, you need a public IP or a DNS name that can be resolved publicly. This requirement of a public IP or a DNS name that can be resolved publicly allows Azure Front Door to route traffic to your backend resources. You can use Azure resources like Application Gateways or Azure Load Balancers to route traffic to resources in a virtual network. If you use Front Door Premium tier, you can use Private Link to connect to origins behind an internal load balancer with a private endpoint. For more information, seeSecure origins with Private Link. An origin group is a collection of origins that can handle similar types of requests. You need a different origin group for each application or workload that is different. In an origin group, you create an origin for every server or service that can serve requests. If your origin has a load balancer, like Azure Application Gateway, or is hosted on a PaaS that has a load balancer, then the origin group only has one origin. Your origin takes care of failover and load balancing between origins that Front Door doesn't see. For example, if you host an application on Azure App Service, how you set up Front Door depends on how many application instances you have: To learn more, seeOrigins and origin groups in Azure Front Door. Azure Front Door is a service that provides fast and reliable web delivery for your applications. It offers features such as caching, load balancing, security, and routing. However, you need to be aware of some timeouts and limits that apply to Azure Front Door. These timeouts and limits include the maximum request size, the maximum response size, the maximum header size, the maximum number of headers, the maximum number of rules, and the maximum number of origin groups. You can find the detailed information about these timeouts and limits in theAzure Front Door documentation. The configuration updates for most rule sets are done in less than 20 minutes. The rule will be applied right after the update is finished. Azure Front Door and Azure CDN are two services that provide fast and reliable web delivery for your applications. However, they aren't compatible with each other, because they share the same network of Azure edge sites to deliver content to your users. This shared network causes conflicts between their routing and caching policies. Therefore, you have to choose either Azure Front Door or Azure CDN for your application, depending on your performance and security requirements. The fact that both profiles would use the same Azure edge sites to handle incoming requests causes this limitation that prevents you from nesting one Azure Front Door profile behind another. This setup would cause routing conflicts and performance issues. Therefore, you should ensure that your Azure Front Door profiles are independent and not chained together, if you need to use multiple profiles for your applications. Azure Front Door uses three service tags to manage the traffic between your clients and your origins: For more information on Azure Front Door service tags scenarios, seeavailable service tags. Azure Front Door has a 5-second timeout for receiving headers from client. The connection is terminated if the client doesn't send headers within 5 seconds to Azure Front Door after establishing TCP/TLS connection. You can't configure this timeout value. Azure Front Door has a 90-second HTTP keep-alive timeout. The connection is terminated if the client doesn't send data for 90 seconds, which is the HTTP keep-alive timeout for Azure Front Door. You can't configure this timeout value. You can't use the same domains for more than one Front Door endpoint, because Front Door needs to distinguish the route (protocol + host + path combination) for each request. If you have duplicate routes across different endpoints, Azure Front Door can't process the requests correctly. At this time, we don't offer the option to move domains from one endpoint to another without any interruption in service. You need to plan for some downtime if you want to migrate your domains to a different endpoint. Azure Front Door Private Link feature is region agnostic and will work even if you choose a region that is different from the region where your origin is located. In such cases, to ensure lower latency, you should always pick an Azure region closest to your origin when choosing to enable Azure Front Door Private Link endpoint. We are in the process of enabling support for more regions. Once a new region is supported, you can follow theseinstructionsto gradually shift traffic to the new region. Azure Front Door is a platform that distributes traffic across the world and can scale up to meet your application's demands. It uses Microsoft's global network edge to deliver global load-balancing capability that lets you switch your entire application or specific microservices to different regions or clouds if there was failure. To avoid errors when delivering large files, make sure your origin server includes theContent-Rangeheader in the response, and that the header value matches the actual size of the response body. You can find more details on how to configure your origin and Front Door for large file delivery inDelivery of large files. Domain fronting is a network technique that enables an attacker to conceal the actual destination of a malicious request by using a different domain name in the TLS handshake and the HTTP host header. Azure Front Door (Standard, Premium and Classic tier) or Azure CDN Standard from Microsoft (classic) resources created after November 8, 2022, have domain fronting blocking enabled. Rather than blocking a request with mismatched SNI and host headers, we permit the discrepancy if the two domains belong to the same subscription and are included in the routes/routing rules. Domain fronting blocking enforcement will start on January 22, 2024, for all existing domains. The enforcement may require up to two weeks to propagate to all regions. When Front Door blocks a request due to a mismatch: For more information about domain fronting, seeSecuring our approach to domain fronting within AzureandProhibiting domain fronting on Azure Front Door and Azure CDN Standard from Microsoft (classic). Front Door uses TLS 1.2 as the minimum version for all profiles created after September 2019. You can choose to use TLS 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 or 1.3 with Azure Front Door. To learn more, read theAzure Front Door end-to-end TLSarticle. Azure Front Door is a service that provides fast and secure web delivery. It allows you to define how your web traffic is routed and optimized across multiple regions and endpoints. Azure Front Door resources, such as Front Door profiles and routing rules, are only charged when they're enabled. However, web application firewall (WAF) policies and rules are charged regardless of their status. Even if you disable a WAF policy or rule, it still incurs costs for you. No. No. AFD does not support dynamic compression for content greater than 8 MB. However, if the content has been already compressed by the origin, Front Door supports serving static compressed content over 8 MB as long as range request is supported and chunked transfer encoding is not enabled. No. For information on logs and other diagnostic capabilities, seeMonitoring metrics and logs for Front Door. You can store diagnostic logs in their own storage account and choose how long to keep them. Alternatively, diagnostic logs can be sent to Event Hubs or Azure Monitor logs. For more information, seeAzure Front Door diagnostics. To access the audit logs of Azure Front Door, you need to visit the portal. Select your Front Door from the menu page and select onActivity Log. The Activity Log provides you with the records of your Azure Front Doorâ€™s operations. You can set up alerts for Azure Front Door based onmetrics or logs. By doing so, you can monitor the performance and health of your front-end hosts. To learn how to create alerts for Azure Front Door Standard and Premium, seeconfigure alerts.

Can a service principal manage application proxy using PowerShell or Microsoft Graph APIs?,"No, this is currently not supported.","Microsoft Entra ID is a cloud-based identity and access management solution. It's a directory and identity management service that operates in the cloud and offers authentication and authorization services to various Microsoft services, such as Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and Microsoft Azure. For more information, seeWhat is Microsoft Entra ID? To access the Microsoft Entra admin center or the Azure portal, each user needs permissions with a valid subscription. If you don't have a paid Microsoft 365 or Microsoft Entra subscription, you need to activate a freeMicrosoft Entra Accountor establish a paid subscription. All Azure subscriptions, whether paid or free, have a trust relationship with a Microsoft Entra tenant. All subscriptions rely on the Microsoft Entra tenant (directory) to authenticate and authorize security principals and devices. For more information, seeHow Azure subscriptions are associated with Microsoft Entra ID. Microsoft Entra ID provides you with common identity and access capabilities to all web services. Whether you're using Microsoft services, such as Microsoft 365, Power Platform, Dynamics 365, or other Microsoft products, you're already using Microsoft Entra ID to help turn on sign-on and access management for all cloud services. All users who are set up to use Microsoft services are defined as user accounts in one or more Microsoft Entra instances, providing these accounts access to Microsoft Entra ID. For more information, seeMicrosoft Entra ID Plans & Pricing Microsoft Entra paid services, such as Enterprise Mobility + Security (Microsoft Enterprise Mobility + Security) complement other Microsoft services like Microsoft 365, with comprehensive enterprise-scale development, management, and security solutions. For more information, see TheMicrosoft Cloud. By default, the person who signs up for a Microsoft Entra or Azure subscription is assigned the Owner role for Azure resources. An Owner can use either a Microsoft account or a work or school account from the directory that the Microsoft Entra or Azure subscription is associated with. This role is also authorized to manage services in the Azure portal. If others need to sign in and access services by using the same subscription, you can assign them the appropriatebuilt-in role. For more information, seeAssign Azure roles using the Azure portal. By default, the user who creates a Microsoft Entra tenant is automatically assigned theGlobal Administratorrole. This user has access to all Microsoft Entra directory features. Microsoft Entra ID has a different set of administrator roles to manage the directory and identity-related features. These administrators have access to various features in the Azure portal. The administrator's role determines what they can do, like create or edit users, assign administrative roles to others, reset user passwords, manage user licenses, or manage domains. For more information, seeAssign a user to administrator roles in Microsoft Entra IDandAssigning administrator roles in Microsoft Entra ID. No.  This isn't currently available. To optimize connectivity between your network and the Microsoft Entra admin center and its services, you might want to add specific Microsoft Entra admin center URLs to your allowlist. Doing so can improve performance and connectivity between your local- or wide area network. Network administrators often deploy proxy servers, firewalls, or other devices, which can help secure and give control over how users access the internet. Rules designed to protect users can sometimes block or slow down legitimate business-related internet traffic. This traffic includes communications between you and Microsoft Entra admin center over the following URLs: For more information, seeUsing Microsoft Entra application proxy to publish on-premises apps for remote users. Additional URLs that you should include are listed in the articleAllow the Azure portal URLs on your firewall or proxy server. You can usually leave an organization on your own without having to contact an administrator. However, in some cases this option isn't available and you need to contact your tenant admin, who can delete your account in the external organization. For more information, seeLeave an organization as an external user. You can connect your on-premises directory to Microsoft Entra ID by using Microsoft Entra Connect. For more information, seeIntegrating your on-premises identities with Microsoft Entra ID. You only need to set up single sign-on (SSO) between your on-premises directory and Microsoft Entra ID. As long as you access your cloud applications through Microsoft Entra ID, the service automatically drives your users to correctly authenticate with their on-premises credentials. Implementing SSO from on-premises can be easily achieved with federation solutions such as Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), or by configuring password hash sync. You can easily deploy both options by using the Microsoft Entra Connect configuration wizard. For more information, seeIntegrating your on-premises identities with Microsoft Entra ID. Yes, Microsoft Entra ID provides you with theMicrosoft Entra ID Access Panelfor user self-service and application access. If you're a Microsoft 365 customer, you can find many of the same capabilities in theOffice 365 portal. For more information, seeIntroduction to the Access Panel. Yes. The Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 edition provides you with Microsoft Entra Connect Health. Microsoft Entra Connect Health helps you monitor and gain insight into your on-premises identity infrastructure and the synchronization services. For more information, seeMonitor your on-premises identity infrastructure and synchronization services in the cloud. (For example, is it possible to use Microsoft Entra self-service password reset (SSPR) with password write-back and not store passwords in the cloud?) This example scenario doesn't require the on-premises password to be tracked in Microsoft Entra. This is because you don't need to synchronize your Active Directory passwords to Microsoft Entra ID to enable write-back. In a federated environment, Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) relies on the on-premises directory to authenticate the user. Password write-back operates in real time. For more information, seeGetting started with password management. Yes, if you have password write-back enabled, the password operations performed by an admin are written back to your on-premises environment. For more answers to password-related questions, seePassword management frequently asked questions. There are a couple of options. You can use the self-service password reset (SSPR) if it's available. Whether SSPR works depends on how it's configured.  For more information about resetting Microsoft Entra passwords, seeHow does the password reset portal work. For Microsoft 365 users, your admin can reset the password by using the steps outlined inReset user passwords. For Microsoft Entra accounts, admins can reset passwords by using one of the following: Microsoft Entra ID uses a more sophisticated strategy to lock accounts. This is based on the IP of the request and the passwords entered. The duration of the lockout also increases based on the likelihood that it's an attack. Rejected passwords return the message 'This password has been used too many times'. This refers to passwords that are globally common, such as any variants of ""Password"" and ""123456"". We do have a gateway that filters requests and provides some protection from botnets, and is applied for all B2C tenants. Microsoft Entra ID has more than 2,600 pre-integrated applications from Microsoft, application service providers, and partners. All pre-integrated applications support single sign-on (SSO). SSO lets you use your organizational credentials to access your apps. Some of the applications also support automated provisioning and de-provisioning. For a complete list of the pre-integrated applications, see theAzure Marketplace. With Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2, you can add and configure any application that you want. Depending on your application's capabilities and your preferences, you can configure SSO and automated provisioning. For more information, seeSingle sign-on SAML protocolandDevelop and plan provisioning for a SCIM endpoint. Microsoft Entra ID provides several ways for users to view and access their applications, such as: For more information, seeEnd user experiences for applications. Microsoft Entra ID supports many standardized protocols for authentication and authorization, such as SAML 2.0, OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, and WS-Federation. Microsoft Entra ID also supports password vaulting and automated sign-in capabilities for apps that only support forms-based authentication. For more information, seeIdentity fundamentalsandSingle sign-on for applications in Microsoft Entra ID. Microsoft Entra application proxyprovides you with easy and secure access to on-premises web applications that you choose. You can access these applications in the same way that you access your software as a service (SaaS) apps in Microsoft Entra ID. There's no need for a VPN or to change your network infrastructure. For more information, seeHow to provide secure remote access to on-premises applications. WithMicrosoft Entra Conditional Access, you can assign a unique access policy for each application. In your policy, you can require multifactor authentication always, or when users aren't connected to the local network. For more information, seeSecuring access to Microsoft 365 and other apps connected to Microsoft Entra ID. Use Microsoft Entra ID to automate the creation, maintenance, and removal of user identities in many popular cloud SaaS apps. For more information, seeWhat is app provisioning in Microsoft Entra ID?. No. Microsoft Entra ID doesn't support the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) protocol or Secure LDAP directly. However, it's possible to enable Microsoft Entra Domain Services instance on your Microsoft Entra tenant with properly configured network security groups through Azure Networking to achieve LDAP connectivity.

If the requested SKU isn't available in the Resource Group, you must create a new App Service Plan in a new Resource Group in the same region or in the same Resource Group using a different region. If you want to reuse the same Resource Group and region, you must delete all the App Services, App Service Plans, andMicrosoft.Web/Certificatesresources in this Resource Group, then create the desired SKU in this Resource Group. Note that migrating App Services originating in this Resource Group to another Resource Group won't unblock the creation. Yes, charges will still apply unless you delete the App Service plan that the web app runs on and its all web apps. To stop all billing associated with your App Service, you need to delete the App Service Plan or scale the App Service Plan to the free tier. For more information, seeHow much does my App Service Plan cost?andPlan and manage costs for Azure App Service. You would need minimum Contributor access on the Resource Group to deploy App Services. If you have Contributor access only on App Service Plan and web app, it won't allow you to create the app service in the Resource Group. For more information, seeAzure built-in roles. During the deletion process, we calculate the usage of the remaining App Service Plans. If they are above the remaining limit, then this error appears. The storage limit is the total content size across all apps in the same App Service Plan. The total content size of all apps across all App Service Plans in a single Resource Group and region can't exceed 500 GB. The file system quota for App Service hosted apps is determined by the aggregate of App Service Plans created in a region and Resource Group.

Article mentioned in question:Add and replace your onmicrosoft.com fallback domain in Microsoft 365","Microsoft Entra ID is a cloud-based identity and access management solution. It's a directory and identity management service that operates in the cloud and offers authentication and authorization services to various Microsoft services, such as Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and Microsoft Azure. For more information, seeWhat is Microsoft Entra ID? To access the Microsoft Entra admin center or the Azure portal, each user needs permissions with a valid subscription. If you don't have a paid Microsoft 365 or Microsoft Entra subscription, you need to activate a freeMicrosoft Entra Accountor establish a paid subscription. All Azure subscriptions, whether paid or free, have a trust relationship with a Microsoft Entra tenant. All subscriptions rely on the Microsoft Entra tenant (directory) to authenticate and authorize security principals and devices. For more information, seeHow Azure subscriptions are associated with Microsoft Entra ID. Microsoft Entra ID provides you with common identity and access capabilities to all web services. Whether you're using Microsoft services, such as Microsoft 365, Power Platform, Dynamics 365, or other Microsoft products, you're already using Microsoft Entra ID to help turn on sign-on and access management for all cloud services. All users who are set up to use Microsoft services are defined as user accounts in one or more Microsoft Entra instances, providing these accounts access to Microsoft Entra ID. For more information, seeMicrosoft Entra ID Plans & Pricing Microsoft Entra paid services, such as Enterprise Mobility + Security (Microsoft Enterprise Mobility + Security) complement other Microsoft services like Microsoft 365, with comprehensive enterprise-scale development, management, and security solutions. For more information, see TheMicrosoft Cloud. By default, the person who signs up for a Microsoft Entra or Azure subscription is assigned the Owner role for Azure resources. An Owner can use either a Microsoft account or a work or school account from the directory that the Microsoft Entra or Azure subscription is associated with. This role is also authorized to manage services in the Azure portal. If others need to sign in and access services by using the same subscription, you can assign them the appropriatebuilt-in role. For more information, seeAssign Azure roles using the Azure portal. By default, the user who creates a Microsoft Entra tenant is automatically assigned theGlobal Administratorrole. This user has access to all Microsoft Entra directory features. Microsoft Entra ID has a different set of administrator roles to manage the directory and identity-related features. These administrators have access to various features in the Azure portal. The administrator's role determines what they can do, like create or edit users, assign administrative roles to others, reset user passwords, manage user licenses, or manage domains. For more information, seeAssign a user to administrator roles in Microsoft Entra IDandAssigning administrator roles in Microsoft Entra ID. No.  This isn't currently available. To optimize connectivity between your network and the Microsoft Entra admin center and its services, you might want to add specific Microsoft Entra admin center URLs to your allowlist. Doing so can improve performance and connectivity between your local- or wide area network. Network administrators often deploy proxy servers, firewalls, or other devices, which can help secure and give control over how users access the internet. Rules designed to protect users can sometimes block or slow down legitimate business-related internet traffic. This traffic includes communications between you and Microsoft Entra admin center over the following URLs: For more information, seeUsing Microsoft Entra application proxy to publish on-premises apps for remote users. Additional URLs that you should include are listed in the articleAllow the Azure portal URLs on your firewall or proxy server. You can usually leave an organization on your own without having to contact an administrator. However, in some cases this option isn't available and you need to contact your tenant admin, who can delete your account in the external organization. For more information, seeLeave an organization as an external user. You can connect your on-premises directory to Microsoft Entra ID by using Microsoft Entra Connect. For more information, seeIntegrating your on-premises identities with Microsoft Entra ID. You only need to set up single sign-on (SSO) between your on-premises directory and Microsoft Entra ID. As long as you access your cloud applications through Microsoft Entra ID, the service automatically drives your users to correctly authenticate with their on-premises credentials. Implementing SSO from on-premises can be easily achieved with federation solutions such as Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), or by configuring password hash sync. You can easily deploy both options by using the Microsoft Entra Connect configuration wizard. For more information, seeIntegrating your on-premises identities with Microsoft Entra ID. Yes, Microsoft Entra ID provides you with theMicrosoft Entra ID Access Panelfor user self-service and application access. If you're a Microsoft 365 customer, you can find many of the same capabilities in theOffice 365 portal. For more information, seeIntroduction to the Access Panel. Yes. The Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 edition provides you with Microsoft Entra Connect Health. Microsoft Entra Connect Health helps you monitor and gain insight into your on-premises identity infrastructure and the synchronization services. For more information, seeMonitor your on-premises identity infrastructure and synchronization services in the cloud. (For example, is it possible to use Microsoft Entra self-service password reset (SSPR) with password write-back and not store passwords in the cloud?) This example scenario doesn't require the on-premises password to be tracked in Microsoft Entra. This is because you don't need to synchronize your Active Directory passwords to Microsoft Entra ID to enable write-back. In a federated environment, Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) relies on the on-premises directory to authenticate the user. Password write-back operates in real time. For more information, seeGetting started with password management. Yes, if you have password write-back enabled, the password operations performed by an admin are written back to your on-premises environment. For more answers to password-related questions, seePassword management frequently asked questions. There are a couple of options. You can use the self-service password reset (SSPR) if it's available. Whether SSPR works depends on how it's configured.  For more information about resetting Microsoft Entra passwords, seeHow does the password reset portal work. For Microsoft 365 users, your admin can reset the password by using the steps outlined inReset user passwords. For Microsoft Entra accounts, admins can reset passwords by using one of the following: Microsoft Entra ID uses a more sophisticated strategy to lock accounts. This is based on the IP of the request and the passwords entered. The duration of the lockout also increases based on the likelihood that it's an attack. Rejected passwords return the message 'This password has been used too many times'. This refers to passwords that are globally common, such as any variants of ""Password"" and ""123456"". We do have a gateway that filters requests and provides some protection from botnets, and is applied for all B2C tenants. Microsoft Entra ID has more than 2,600 pre-integrated applications from Microsoft, application service providers, and partners. All pre-integrated applications support single sign-on (SSO). SSO lets you use your organizational credentials to access your apps. Some of the applications also support automated provisioning and de-provisioning. For a complete list of the pre-integrated applications, see theAzure Marketplace. With Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2, you can add and configure any application that you want. Depending on your application's capabilities and your preferences, you can configure SSO and automated provisioning. For more information, seeSingle sign-on SAML protocolandDevelop and plan provisioning for a SCIM endpoint. Microsoft Entra ID provides several ways for users to view and access their applications, such as: For more information, seeEnd user experiences for applications. Microsoft Entra ID supports many standardized protocols for authentication and authorization, such as SAML 2.0, OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, and WS-Federation. Microsoft Entra ID also supports password vaulting and automated sign-in capabilities for apps that only support forms-based authentication. For more information, seeIdentity fundamentalsandSingle sign-on for applications in Microsoft Entra ID. Microsoft Entra application proxyprovides you with easy and secure access to on-premises web applications that you choose. You can access these applications in the same way that you access your software as a service (SaaS) apps in Microsoft Entra ID. There's no need for a VPN or to change your network infrastructure. For more information, seeHow to provide secure remote access to on-premises applications. WithMicrosoft Entra Conditional Access, you can assign a unique access policy for each application. In your policy, you can require multifactor authentication always, or when users aren't connected to the local network. For more information, seeSecuring access to Microsoft 365 and other apps connected to Microsoft Entra ID. Use Microsoft Entra ID to automate the creation, maintenance, and removal of user identities in many popular cloud SaaS apps. For more information, seeWhat is app provisioning in Microsoft Entra ID?. No. Microsoft Entra ID doesn't support the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) protocol or Secure LDAP directly. However, it's possible to enable Microsoft Entra Domain Services instance on your Microsoft Entra tenant with properly configured network security groups through Azure Networking to achieve LDAP connectivity.

Microsoft Support:To create a new support request, in the Azure portal, on theHelptab, select theHelp + supportbutton, and then selectNew support request. Azure Front Door is a cloud-based service that delivers your applications faster and more reliably. It uses layer 7 load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple regions and endpoints. It also offers dynamic site acceleration (DSA) to optimize web performance and near real-time failover to ensure high availability. Azure Front Door is a fully managed service, so you don't have to worry about scaling or maintenance. Azure Front Door is a service that offers many benefits for your web applications, such as dynamic site acceleration (DSA), which improves the performance and user experience of your sites. Azure Front Door also handles TLS/SSL offloading and end to end TLS, which enhances the security and encryption of your web traffic. Additionally, Azure Front Door provides Web Application Firewall, cookie-based session affinity, url path-based routing, free certificates and multiple domain managements, and more. To learn more about the features and capabilities of Azure Front Door, seetier comparison. Azure Front Door and Azure Application Gateway are both load balancers for HTTP/HTTPS traffic, but they have different scopes. Front Door is a global service that can distribute requests across regions, while Application Gateway is a regional service that can balance requests within a region. Azure Front Door works with scale units, clusters or stamp units, while Azure Application Gateway works with VMs, containers or other resources in the same scale unit. Application Gateway behind Front Door is useful in these situations: Chaining two CDNs is generally not a recommended approach, it would work but comes with the following cons To use Azure Front Door, you must have a public VIP or a DNS name that is publicly accessible. Azure Front Door uses the public IP to route the traffic to your origin. A common scenario is to deploy an Azure Load Balancer behind Front Door. You can also use Private Link with Azure Front Door Premium to connect to an internal load balancer. For more information, seeenable Private Link with internal load balancer. Azure Front Door supports HTTP, HTTPS and HTTP/2. Azure Front Door supports HTTP/2 protocol for client connections. However, the backend pool communication uses HTTP/1.1 protocol. HTTP/2 support is on by default. You can use different types of origins for Azure Front Door, such as: The origin must have a public IP or a DNS hostname that can be resolved publicly. You can mix and match backends from different zones, regions, or even outside of Azure, as long as they're publicly accessible. Azure Front Door isn't limited to any Azure region, but operates globally. The only location you have to choose when you create a Front Door is the location of the resource group, which determines where the resource group's metadata get stored. The Front Door profile is a global resource and its configuration is distributed to all edge locations worldwide. For the complete list of points of presence (POPs) that provide global load balancing and content delivery for Azure Front Door, seeAzure Front Door POP locations. This list is updated regularly as new POPs are added or removed. You can also use the Azure Resource Manager API to query the current list of POPs programmatically. Azure Front Door is a service that distributes your application globally across multiple regions. It uses a common infrastructure that gets shared by all its customers, but you can customize your own Front Door profile to configure your application's specific requirements. Other customers' configurations can't affect your Front Door configuration, which is isolated from theirs. You can redirect host, path, and query string components of a URL with Azure Front Door. To learn how to configure URL redirection, refer toURL redirection. Front Door doesn't sort the routes for your web application. Instead, it chooses the route that best fits the request. To find out how Front Door matches requests to routes, seeHow Front Door matches requests to a routing rule. To ensure optimal performance of Front Door's features, you should only allow traffic that comes from Azure Front Door to reach your origin. As a result, unauthorized or malicious requests encounter the security and routing policies of Front Door and are denied access. To learn how to secure your origin, seeSecure traffic to Azure Front Door origins. The IP address of your Front Door's frontend anycast is fixed and might not change as long as you use the Front Door. However, the fixed IP address of your Front Door's frontend anycast isn't a guarantee. Avoid relying on the IP directly. Azure Front Door is a dynamic service that routes traffic to the best available backend. It doesn't offer static or dedicated frontend anycast IPs at this time. Yes. Refer to the MatchedRulesSetName property underAccess Logs. Yes. For more information, seeMicrosoft response to DDoS attacks against HTTP/2. Azure Front Door supports the X-Forwarded-For, X-Forwarded-Host, and X-Forwarded-Proto headers. These headers help Front Door identify the original client IP and protocol. If X-Forwarded-For is already present, Front Door adds the client socket IP to the end of the list. Otherwise, it creates the header with the client socket IP as the value. For X-Forwarded-Host and X-Forwarded-Proto, Front Door replaces the existing values with its own. For more information, seeFront Door supported HTTP headers. The deployment time for new Front Door configurations varies depending on the type of change. Typically, it takes between 3 and 20 minutes for the changes to propagate to all our edge locations worldwide. Note Custom TLS/SSL certificate updates might take longer, from several minutes up to an hour, to be deployed globally. Updates to routes or origin groups/backend pools are seamless and don't cause any downtime (assuming the new configuration is correct). Certificate updates are also done atomically, so there's no risk of outage. No. Currently, Azure Front Door only supports HTTP/1.1 from the edge to the origin. For gRPC to work, HTTP/2 is required. To use Azure Front Door Standard, Premium or (classic) tier, you need a public IP or a DNS name that can be resolved publicly. This requirement of a public IP or a DNS name that can be resolved publicly allows Azure Front Door to route traffic to your backend resources. You can use Azure resources like Application Gateways or Azure Load Balancers to route traffic to resources in a virtual network. If you use Front Door Premium tier, you can use Private Link to connect to origins behind an internal load balancer with a private endpoint. For more information, seeSecure origins with Private Link. An origin group is a collection of origins that can handle similar types of requests. You need a different origin group for each application or workload that is different. In an origin group, you create an origin for every server or service that can serve requests. If your origin has a load balancer, like Azure Application Gateway, or is hosted on a PaaS that has a load balancer, then the origin group only has one origin. Your origin takes care of failover and load balancing between origins that Front Door doesn't see. For example, if you host an application on Azure App Service, how you set up Front Door depends on how many application instances you have: To learn more, seeOrigins and origin groups in Azure Front Door. Azure Front Door is a service that provides fast and reliable web delivery for your applications. It offers features such as caching, load balancing, security, and routing. However, you need to be aware of some timeouts and limits that apply to Azure Front Door. These timeouts and limits include the maximum request size, the maximum response size, the maximum header size, the maximum number of headers, the maximum number of rules, and the maximum number of origin groups. You can find the detailed information about these timeouts and limits in theAzure Front Door documentation. The configuration updates for most rule sets are done in less than 20 minutes. The rule will be applied right after the update is finished. Azure Front Door and Azure CDN are two services that provide fast and reliable web delivery for your applications. However, they aren't compatible with each other, because they share the same network of Azure edge sites to deliver content to your users. This shared network causes conflicts between their routing and caching policies. Therefore, you have to choose either Azure Front Door or Azure CDN for your application, depending on your performance and security requirements. The fact that both profiles would use the same Azure edge sites to handle incoming requests causes this limitation that prevents you from nesting one Azure Front Door profile behind another. This setup would cause routing conflicts and performance issues. Therefore, you should ensure that your Azure Front Door profiles are independent and not chained together, if you need to use multiple profiles for your applications. Azure Front Door uses three service tags to manage the traffic between your clients and your origins: For more information on Azure Front Door service tags scenarios, seeavailable service tags. Azure Front Door has a 5-second timeout for receiving headers from client. The connection is terminated if the client doesn't send headers within 5 seconds to Azure Front Door after establishing TCP/TLS connection. You can't configure this timeout value. Azure Front Door has a 90-second HTTP keep-alive timeout. The connection is terminated if the client doesn't send data for 90 seconds, which is the HTTP keep-alive timeout for Azure Front Door. You can't configure this timeout value. You can't use the same domains for more than one Front Door endpoint, because Front Door needs to distinguish the route (protocol + host + path combination) for each request. If you have duplicate routes across different endpoints, Azure Front Door can't process the requests correctly. At this time, we don't offer the option to move domains from one endpoint to another without any interruption in service. You need to plan for some downtime if you want to migrate your domains to a different endpoint. Azure Front Door Private Link feature is region agnostic and will work even if you choose a region that is different from the region where your origin is located. In such cases, to ensure lower latency, you should always pick an Azure region closest to your origin when choosing to enable Azure Front Door Private Link endpoint. We are in the process of enabling support for more regions. Once a new region is supported, you can follow theseinstructionsto gradually shift traffic to the new region. Azure Front Door is a platform that distributes traffic across the world and can scale up to meet your application's demands. It uses Microsoft's global network edge to deliver global load-balancing capability that lets you switch your entire application or specific microservices to different regions or clouds if there was failure. To avoid errors when delivering large files, make sure your origin server includes theContent-Rangeheader in the response, and that the header value matches the actual size of the response body. You can find more details on how to configure your origin and Front Door for large file delivery inDelivery of large files. Domain fronting is a network technique that enables an attacker to conceal the actual destination of a malicious request by using a different domain name in the TLS handshake and the HTTP host header. Azure Front Door (Standard, Premium and Classic tier) or Azure CDN Standard from Microsoft (classic) resources created after November 8, 2022, have domain fronting blocking enabled. Rather than blocking a request with mismatched SNI and host headers, we permit the discrepancy if the two domains belong to the same subscription and are included in the routes/routing rules. Domain fronting blocking enforcement will start on January 22, 2024, for all existing domains. The enforcement may require up to two weeks to propagate to all regions. When Front Door blocks a request due to a mismatch: For more information about domain fronting, seeSecuring our approach to domain fronting within AzureandProhibiting domain fronting on Azure Front Door and Azure CDN Standard from Microsoft (classic). Front Door uses TLS 1.2 as the minimum version for all profiles created after September 2019. You can choose to use TLS 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 or 1.3 with Azure Front Door. To learn more, read theAzure Front Door end-to-end TLSarticle. Azure Front Door is a service that provides fast and secure web delivery. It allows you to define how your web traffic is routed and optimized across multiple regions and endpoints. Azure Front Door resources, such as Front Door profiles and routing rules, are only charged when they're enabled. However, web application firewall (WAF) policies and rules are charged regardless of their status. Even if you disable a WAF policy or rule, it still incurs costs for you. No. No. AFD does not support dynamic compression for content greater than 8 MB. However, if the content has been already compressed by the origin, Front Door supports serving static compressed content over 8 MB as long as range request is supported and chunked transfer encoding is not enabled. No. For information on logs and other diagnostic capabilities, seeMonitoring metrics and logs for Front Door. You can store diagnostic logs in their own storage account and choose how long to keep them. Alternatively, diagnostic logs can be sent to Event Hubs or Azure Monitor logs. For more information, seeAzure Front Door diagnostics. To access the audit logs of Azure Front Door, you need to visit the portal. Select your Front Door from the menu page and select onActivity Log. The Activity Log provides you with the records of your Azure Front Doorâ€™s operations. You can set up alerts for Azure Front Door based onmetrics or logs. By doing so, you can monitor the performance and health of your front-end hosts. To learn how to create alerts for Azure Front Door Standard and Premium, seeconfigure alerts.

For organizations committed to the Microsoft 365 cloud, Universal Print is the modern, cloud-based print solution that provides robust and centralized print management capabilities and a straightforward end user experience, while eliminating the need to maintain traditional on-premises print servers, active directory, or install printer drivers. Universal Print is a multi-tenant print solution service hosted on Azure. For organizations that are committed to Microsoft 365 cloud, it replaces the Windows Server print server functionality. Universal Print allows IT departments to configure their organization's printers so that employees can print seamlessly from any device, and for organizations to lower the cost of printing, while supporting their business needs. Printer manufacturers, software providers, and service providers can build on the cloud service to deliver advanced functionality. Universal Print is for customers who are moving to the cloud and need the ability to print using a cloud service, as Microsoft Entra ID joined devices are unable to discover printers on local print servers. Therefore, customers seek a solution from Microsoft to remove the need for on-premises print servers and gateways. A Universal Print ready / compatible printer is a printer that has a Universal Print compatible firmware.
Printer manufacturers are releasing new printers that are Universal Print ready. Printers currently in the market may become Universal Print ready with firmware updates. See theUniversal Print web pageto find out more about Universal Print ready printers and print solutions from our partners. For Universal Print, Windows devices must be connected to Microsoft Entra ID. Hybrid joined devices will work too provided they are joined to Microsoft Entra ID. You can check if a device is joined to Microsoft Entra ID by launching command prompt and running the following command: ReadGet access to Universal Printfor more details. We have a connector for current printers that have no updated firmware. The connector is a small Windows application that can connect many printers to the Microsoft 365 cloud, and can run on any Windows PC on the network. Refer toInstalling the Universal Print connectorfor more information. Yes, the connector can run on a Windows Server. Refer toInstalling the Universal Print connectorfor minimum version support. Yes, if the VM has network access to the printers on the organization's network. No, the connector is only available for Windows Client and Windows Server. There is no enforced maximum. It depends on available resources on the connector PC. Please refer to thearticle about connector configurationfor detailed guidance. Connector needs to be connected to the same network as printers, available 24x7 and connected to internet. Connector is a solution to support your existing printers. As new printers that support Universal Print natively are launched, the connector wonâ€™t be required for those printers. Universal Print is currently available in both GCC and GCC High. For more information, please see ourUniversal Print in Governmentdocumentation. All the data in transit is encrypted using SSL (https) with TLS 1.2. In the cloud, print data is stored the Office storage partitioned for each customer - this is same storage used for mail, OneDrive etc. Universal Print stores all print queues in Office data storage. This is the same storage that stores customer's Office 365 mailboxes and OneDrive files. A job stays in the print queue for a few days. If job is not claimed at the printer within three days, it gets marked as aborted. Even after printing, a job may stay in Universal Print for a few more days (up to a total of 10 days). Universal Print currently does not have these capabilities, but we are working on coming up with new features to address customer needs. Please file new ideas or vote for the existing ones atUniversal Print Feature Requests Microsoft Entra ID users and groups are used for assigning access to printers. None! There are no incoming requests to printers or connectors (all requests are outgoing). As long as Universal Print endpoints are not blocked, everything will work. Note that using wildcards, e.g. ""*.print.microsoft.com"" and ""*.applicationinsights.azure.com"" may be preferable for firewall configuration for simplicity or in case new services or endpoints are deployed in future. Commercial GCC GCC uses Commercial endpoints as well as the following: GCC High Connector In addition to the relevant endpoints above, the Universal Print connector needs access to the following: Universal Print is available in GCC and GCC High. Please seeherefor more details. Yes. With Universal Print, users can print to any printers within their organizations by just connecting to internet. There is no need for VPN or being on same local network. Universal Print offers multiple ways in which a location can be specified. You can use the Country, City, Building, Floor etc. Alternatively, we have built GPS based location proximity. If admin specifies the latitude and longitude of the printer in Universal Print portal, and same is available for the user, we will do the nearest match. Yes. If the user has GPS location, and admin has specified printers' locations with latitude and longitude, then the printers can be found based on proximity. Yes, the Universal Print section in administrative portal allows you to configure default printing preferences for each printer. PowerShell is on our roadmap. Details will be shared soon. Tools can also use Graph API. To learn more, visitUniversal Print cloud printing API overview. Currently administrators have access to a basic set of reports that include print usage grouped by user or printer. Universal Print has been validated to work within the same Microsoft Entra ID tenant. To enable printing across tenants, you may create a new feature ask or vote for an existing one atUniversal Print Feature Requests. Some bulk capabilities already exist (like registering multiple printers at the same time on a single connector). We are working on PowerShell support which will enable writing scripts for bulk jobs. Additionally, we are considering bulk scenarios for UI improvements as well. For specific ideas we recommend you to create a new feature ask or vote for an existing one atUniversal Print Feature Requests. Yes, access control to the printer supports them. Universal Print is a replacement for Hybrid Cloud Print. Universal Print addresses additional scenarios, and is much easier to set up and scalable. For Windows device to work with Universal Print, HCP settings need to be cleaned up. Delete the following registry key to clean-up HCP settings: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\PolicyManager\current\<SID>\EnterpriseCloudPrint If Intune or any other MDM solution was used to deploy the HCP setting, then ensure that the corresponding policy is removed. Otherwise the HCP setting will be pushed again on the Windows device. Please take a look atService Level Agreements (SLA) for Online Services. Check the latest version of the SLA and look for ""Universal Print"" in the table of contents. There is no driver pushed to the users' machines. Support to print to Universal Print is built into Windows. Universal Print is based on PWG's IPP standard, and supportsIPP PDLs. We are working through the list of those PDLs. Universal Print printers connect to internet and spool jobs in cloud using the service hosted in Azure. Currently all jobs are spooled in cloud and routed via Azure. For new feature ideas or to vote for the existing ones, please go toUniversal Print Feature Requests. No, user will not be able to print unless the device is connected to internet. Connector needs to be connected to the Universal Print service via internet as well to get the print jobs that are spooled in the cloud. Universal Print provides limited support for label printers. Please seedetails in this article. Universal Print currently supports page printers only. We made these printers the higher priority because they are more widespread and versatile. Plotter printers are a totally different class of printers that require special handling of paper roll size definition and other plotter specific functionalities. We plan to investigate adding support for plotter printers in Universal Print. We currently have no projected date of when they will be supported.

"What are the challenges, if the external and the internal URLs are different?","Some responses sent by the published web applications might contain hard-coded URLs.
In this case it must be ensured by using a link translation solution that the client always uses the correct URL.
Link translation solutions might be complex and might not work in all the scenarios. You can findhereour documented solutions for link translation. As best practice it's advised to use identical external and internal URLs. External and internal URLs are considered to be identical, if theprotocol://hostname:port/path/in both URLs are identical. This can be achieved by using theCustom Domainsfeature. Examples: Identical: Not identical: Making the external and internal URLs identical isn't possible at all, if the internal URL contains a nonstandard port (other than TCP 80 / 443).

There is a separateFAQ wikithat Partner can share with their Customers post-production. - Integration Phase - Data Privacy - Customer Setup - Product Functionality: One-Click Export - Product Functionality: Misc - Certification Please referenceRSC developer documentation Reach out to LinkedIn Business Development to fill out the Onboarding Request Form and follow steps in theRSC developer documentation. New Talent Solutions integrations like Recruiter System Connect are built on the Middleware Platform, which means you should manage job applications via the /atsApplications and  /atsCandidates endpoint instead of /simpleJobApplications. If youâ€™ve previously integrated with LinkedIn Referrals, youâ€™ll need to switch to using the Middleware Platform for submitting job applications. No. The minimum product and technical requirements for RSC are indicated in this document and partners may not elect to enable a subset. We require all historical candidate, applications, and jobs records to ensure LinkedIn Recruiter is as valuable as possible for your customers [i.e. the â€œRediscovered Candidatesâ€ Spotlight, â€˜In-ATS Indicatorâ€™] Many customers will not need to do so if their privacy policies allows them to share candidate data to their third party partners. However, customers will need to consult their own legal teams regarding this prior to activating RSC. Some partners include a disclaimer in the onboarding widget that requires the customer to authorize the sharing of ATS data with LinkedIn. Customers will be able to turn on all their middleware integrations via a widget in the ATS and in their Recruiter dashboard. Seetechnical docs Customers must email the Partner and LinkedIn support notifying us they would like to deactivate RSC. Customer can contact LinkedIn support at ltsatsintegrations@linkedin.com Rcorp (Recruiter Corporate), RPS (Recruiter Professional Services), and Recruiter SMB The ATS partner can confirm the duplication was handled in the ATS when LI passes back the PersonURN (Member ID) to the ATS Partner LinkedIn members that don't have their privacy settings set to share their profile with third parties will not have One-Click Export functionality enabled. Customer can create a standard ""dummy req"" field in the drop down that Recruiter will be able to export the candidate to if they do not want to associate the candidate with a Job Req. ATS can then conduct any matching required on their end. However, customers will need to consult their legal team to determine if they can export data unassociated with a requisition. Yes it will show all open jobs that the user has permissions to see based on Security Groups. If a Partner has not enabled Security Groups, all open jobs will be seen by all users. Customers can search for jobs based on type head Call volume for One-Click Export is 300 calls per Recruiter seat per month. LinkedIn reserves the right to change rate limits including to prevent abuse and protect privacy and security. ATS will validate this push event against the signature in the request, outlined in ourdocumentation. This is an expected behavior, whencompanyJobCodeexist, it takes precedence overexternalJobPostingId LI will post jobs based on the language that the customer posts in. If the job requires multiple languages, the customer should have separate listings for each language. The preferred integration is to send in real-time Jobs will default to 180 days if there is no expiration date passed in. For jobs with multiple locations, the current solution is to post one requisition per location. Or, send only the primary location if that designation exists.
For jobs with no location (e.g. virtual jobs), you may either: Not send these jobs, or Default to a specific location (for example, headquarter). Jobs will not be posted without a location No, the way the middleware platform is architected, it needs to be through the Simple Job Posting API. Yes, LinkedIn integrations are set up at the contract level, so customers can have separate integrations for any of their contracts. Recruiter users can switch between contracts, and each contract can be associated with one or more integrations.
Partners must be able to support multiple contracts for the same customer. There is an â€œSend InMailâ€ button in the profile widget that allows sending InMails. It sends a notification to the ATS user in LinkedIn Recruiter when there are profile updates for the relevant candidate. If a candidate deletes their LinkedIn account, they can reactivate it within 21 days. After 21 days, we purge the deleted accounts and populate that information within theClosed Candidates Endpoint. Our ATS partners must query this endpoint periodically (at least once in 30 days) and purge the accounts (that appear within this endpoint) from their records. When an API Job is designated asBasic, either by creating a new Basic API Job or by inline downgrading aPremiumAPI Job, it will be visible in the RSC 1CE (one click export).
Inline upgrading aBasicAPI Job to aPremiumJob does not change its visibility in the RSC 1CE; the job remains visible until it is closed.
Similarly, inline downgrading aPremiumAPI Job to aBasicJob will make the job appear in the RSC 1CE. No updates to an API Job, except for theCLOSEaction, are sent to the RSC.
We will implement a change, once ready, where public and private jobs will be synchronized separately. Until your integration aligns with this update, the above recommendation applies to your ATS. Yes, it's an all-or-nothing integration (with the exception of the feature that enables the sending of Interview Notes and Feedback to LinkedIn Recruiter, which is optional) ; however partners can test and certify each module along the way prior to launch. The requirements are laid out in thedeveloperandrequired fieldsdocumentation. First name and last name are used as part of our matching algorithm, though the fields are optional. The preference would be to split firstName and lastName if you have it The throttling is based on the number of API calls being made. We don't have any maximum limits of how much data can be synced by customers. The Sync API will consider any data after the initial push as an update.  As long as you are sending the correct fields and values against it, there should be no problem. This varies across our ATS partners, however we generally see this reflected within a few minutes. Ideally this should be as real-time as possible. Yes, the button should show up if there was a network error. Once the request is sent, the button changes to Notify Partner, after this you should be able to call /atsIntegrationsAPI. People are matched on the basis of email first and then phone number, subject to the relevant memberâ€™s privacy settings. If the matching made is incorrect or cannot be found, LinkedIn allows the Customer to manually match in the Profile Widget. Refer to thisAPI. This updates the 'manualMatchedMember' attribute for synced candidates. It is advised that if the value for the manualMatchedMember field is present then ATS should always use that instead of the values present in the 'matchedMembers' attribute. The jobs are sent in a sequence and also returned back in a sequence. So you would be keeping track of the sequence and able to match it accordingly. No. The minimum character length is to ensure this is a genuine job and not spam. We accept only quality jobs so that is why we have the restriction. If the description is within 10K characters, this should be fine. Within the widget there is a callback function parameter which on link / unlink allows your system to add or update the appropriate person URN to update and store. The person URN connects the candidate to the job post and all other information related to the candidate including notes, job application status, etc. Usein.parse()to reload the widget on a single page application. The Linkedin LTS Partner Operations (PO) team proactively renews contracts. This is a monthly activity and we renew your contract once its near expiry. This gives a seamless LinkedIn RSC experience without the need to raise a ticket for contract renewal. It is recommended to test the InMail functionality for RSC Integrations by sending InMails to your first degree connections. One can send unlimited inMails because there is no restriction to it. To be able to test this feature, the users should be connected to the developers of our team. Through ACL, we control the visibility of any jobs to only user(s). ACLs consist of two parts -atsEntityAclsfor groups andatsEntityAclAssigneesfor members who can view the jobs.

When should I use the PrincipalsAllowedToDelegateToAccount method when setting up Kerberos Constrained Delegation (KCD)?,"The PrincipalsAllowedToDelegateToAccount method is used when connector servers are in a different domain from the web application service account. It requires the use of Resource-based Constrained Delegation.
If the connector servers and the web application service account are in the same domain, you can use Active Directory Users and Computers to configure the delegation settings on each of the connector machine accounts, allowing them to delegate to the target SPN. If the connector servers and the web application service account are in different domains, Resource-based delegation is used. The delegation permissions are configured on the target web server and web application service account. This method of Constrained Delegation is relatively new. The method was introduced in Windows Server 2012, which supports cross-domain delegation by allowing the resource (web service) owner to control which machine and service accounts can delegate to it. There's no UI to assist with this configuration, so you need to use PowerShell.
For more information, see the whitepaperUnderstanding Kerberos Constrained Delegation with application proxy.","This article contains answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs) about using Delegated Managed Service Accounts (dMSA) in Windows Server 2025. No, you must have at least one Windows Server 2025 DC, which must be discoverable by the client or member server. Yes, this configuration is supported provided the following prerequisites are met: The dMSA account must be cached on the RODC. The dMSA account must be manually added to thePrincipalsAllowedToRetrieveManagedPasswordattribute of the machine by running the following command: No, you can't force a password reset for a dMSA account. No, this scenario isn't supported. To learn more, seeDelegated Managed Service Accounts overview. No, each service account must have its own dMSA. You can't migrate multiple service accounts to a single dMSA. Yes, you can replace the service account with a dMSA. This process would require: The service will start using the newly created and configured dMSA only after the migration process is complete. The service account is disabled, and its information, including permissions, SPNs, and delegation, will be moved to the dMSA account.
However, you should keep the service account intact because: No, all your clients and/or servers must be running on dMSA-supported operating system to perform the migration. No, it isn't recommended to reset the password during the migration process. Yes, you can undo a migration or unlink a service account and start from scratch. Use theUndo-ADServiceAccountMigrationorReset-ADServiceAccountMigrationcmdlets. Yes, you can move the disabled service account to another OU. Delegated Managed Service Accounts FAQ In this article General Can I just extend the schema to Windows Server 2025 and then use a Windows Server 2025 member server to start using dMSA without having a Windows Server 2025 Domain Controller (DC)? My application server running a service account is behind a Read-Only DC (RODC) with no connectivity to a Read/Write DC.
Is this a supported configuration for dMSA? Can I force a password reset for a dMSA account? Migration Can I migrate a gMSA to a dMSA account? I have three service accounts in my environment running different application workloads. Can I migrate all three service accounts to a single dMSA? Instead of migrating the service account, can I reconfigure all of my services to a new dMSA? If I have a SQL Server farm currently using a service account,
and want to avoid the hassle of migration, can I replace my service account with a dMSA? Will my service start using the dMSA during the migration process or only after the migration is complete? Can I delete the service account after migration? What should I do with the service account post-migration? I have three Windows Server 2022 operating systems and one Windows Server 2025 operating system running my SQL application.
Can I migrate to dMSA in a Windows Server 2025 domain environment? Can I reset the password of my service account after I have started the migration process but before it's complete? What if I mistakenly migrated a service account that shouldn't have been migrated? Can I undo or unlink the migration? I have migrated a service account, and it's now automatically disabled. Can I move the service account to a different Organizational Unit (OU)? See also",0.5112607479095459
Does NTLM authentication work with Microsoft Entra application proxy?,NTLM authentication canâ€™t be used as a preauthentication or single sign-on method. NTLM authentication can be used only when it can be negotiated directly between the client and the published web application. Using NTLM authentication usually causes a sign-in prompt to appear in the browser.,"Microsoft Entra ID is a cloud-based identity and access management solution. It's a directory and identity management service that operates in the cloud and offers authentication and authorization services to various Microsoft services, such as Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and Microsoft Azure. For more information, seeWhat is Microsoft Entra ID? To access the Microsoft Entra admin center or the Azure portal, each user needs permissions with a valid subscription. If you don't have a paid Microsoft 365 or Microsoft Entra subscription, you need to activate a freeMicrosoft Entra Accountor establish a paid subscription. All Azure subscriptions, whether paid or free, have a trust relationship with a Microsoft Entra tenant. All subscriptions rely on the Microsoft Entra tenant (directory) to authenticate and authorize security principals and devices. For more information, seeHow Azure subscriptions are associated with Microsoft Entra ID. Microsoft Entra ID provides you with common identity and access capabilities to all web services. Whether you're using Microsoft services, such as Microsoft 365, Power Platform, Dynamics 365, or other Microsoft products, you're already using Microsoft Entra ID to help turn on sign-on and access management for all cloud services. All users who are set up to use Microsoft services are defined as user accounts in one or more Microsoft Entra instances, providing these accounts access to Microsoft Entra ID. For more information, seeMicrosoft Entra ID Plans & Pricing Microsoft Entra paid services, such as Enterprise Mobility + Security (Microsoft Enterprise Mobility + Security) complement other Microsoft services like Microsoft 365, with comprehensive enterprise-scale development, management, and security solutions. For more information, see TheMicrosoft Cloud. By default, the person who signs up for a Microsoft Entra or Azure subscription is assigned the Owner role for Azure resources. An Owner can use either a Microsoft account or a work or school account from the directory that the Microsoft Entra or Azure subscription is associated with. This role is also authorized to manage services in the Azure portal. If others need to sign in and access services by using the same subscription, you can assign them the appropriatebuilt-in role. For more information, seeAssign Azure roles using the Azure portal. By default, the user who creates a Microsoft Entra tenant is automatically assigned theGlobal Administratorrole. This user has access to all Microsoft Entra directory features. Microsoft Entra ID has a different set of administrator roles to manage the directory and identity-related features. These administrators have access to various features in the Azure portal. The administrator's role determines what they can do, like create or edit users, assign administrative roles to others, reset user passwords, manage user licenses, or manage domains. For more information, seeAssign a user to administrator roles in Microsoft Entra IDandAssigning administrator roles in Microsoft Entra ID. No.  This isn't currently available. To optimize connectivity between your network and the Microsoft Entra admin center and its services, you might want to add specific Microsoft Entra admin center URLs to your allowlist. Doing so can improve performance and connectivity between your local- or wide area network. Network administrators often deploy proxy servers, firewalls, or other devices, which can help secure and give control over how users access the internet. Rules designed to protect users can sometimes block or slow down legitimate business-related internet traffic. This traffic includes communications between you and Microsoft Entra admin center over the following URLs: For more information, seeUsing Microsoft Entra application proxy to publish on-premises apps for remote users. Additional URLs that you should include are listed in the articleAllow the Azure portal URLs on your firewall or proxy server. You can usually leave an organization on your own without having to contact an administrator. However, in some cases this option isn't available and you need to contact your tenant admin, who can delete your account in the external organization. For more information, seeLeave an organization as an external user. You can connect your on-premises directory to Microsoft Entra ID by using Microsoft Entra Connect. For more information, seeIntegrating your on-premises identities with Microsoft Entra ID. You only need to set up single sign-on (SSO) between your on-premises directory and Microsoft Entra ID. As long as you access your cloud applications through Microsoft Entra ID, the service automatically drives your users to correctly authenticate with their on-premises credentials. Implementing SSO from on-premises can be easily achieved with federation solutions such as Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), or by configuring password hash sync. You can easily deploy both options by using the Microsoft Entra Connect configuration wizard. For more information, seeIntegrating your on-premises identities with Microsoft Entra ID. Yes, Microsoft Entra ID provides you with theMicrosoft Entra ID Access Panelfor user self-service and application access.

For more information, seeMonitor your on-premises identity infrastructure and synchronization services in the cloud. (For example, is it possible to use Microsoft Entra self-service password reset (SSPR) with password write-back and not store passwords in the cloud?) This example scenario doesn't require the on-premises password to be tracked in Microsoft Entra. This is because you don't need to synchronize your Active Directory passwords to Microsoft Entra ID to enable write-back. In a federated environment, Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) relies on the on-premises directory to authenticate the user. Password write-back operates in real time. For more information, seeGetting started with password management. Yes, if you have password write-back enabled, the password operations performed by an admin are written back to your on-premises environment. For more answers to password-related questions, seePassword management frequently asked questions. There are a couple of options. You can use the self-service password reset (SSPR) if it's available. Whether SSPR works depends on how it's configured.  For more information about resetting Microsoft Entra passwords, seeHow does the password reset portal work. For Microsoft 365 users, your admin can reset the password by using the steps outlined inReset user passwords. For Microsoft Entra accounts, admins can reset passwords by using one of the following: Microsoft Entra ID uses a more sophisticated strategy to lock accounts. This is based on the IP of the request and the passwords entered. The duration of the lockout also increases based on the likelihood that it's an attack. Rejected passwords return the message 'This password has been used too many times'. This refers to passwords that are globally common, such as any variants of ""Password"" and ""123456"". We do have a gateway that filters requests and provides some protection from botnets, and is applied for all B2C tenants. Microsoft Entra ID has more than 2,600 pre-integrated applications from Microsoft, application service providers, and partners. All pre-integrated applications support single sign-on (SSO). SSO lets you use your organizational credentials to access your apps. Some of the applications also support automated provisioning and de-provisioning.

Can I use Conditional Access Policies for applications published with passthrough preauthentication?,"Conditional Access Policies are only enforced for successfully authenticated users in Microsoft Entra ID. Passthrough preauthentication doesnâ€™t trigger Microsoft Entra authentication, so Conditional Access Policies can't be enforced. With passthrough preauthentication, MFA policies must be implemented on the on-premises server, if possible, or by enabling Microsoft Entra ID preauthentication with Microsoft Entra application proxy.","This article addresses frequently asked questions about Microsoft Entra pass-through authentication. Keep checking back for updated content. Reviewthis guidefor a comparison of the various Microsoft Entra sign-in methods and how to choose the right sign-in method for your organization. Pass-through Authentication is a free feature. You don't need any paid editions of Microsoft Entra ID to use it. Yes. AllConditional Accesscapabilities, including Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication, work with Pass-through Authentication. Yes, both pass-through authentication (PTA) and password hash sync (PHS) support sign-in using a non-UPN value, such as an alternate email. For more information aboutAlternate Sign-in ID. No. Pass-through Authenticationdoesn'tautomatically failover to password hash synchronization. To avoid user sign-in failures, you should configure Pass-through Authentication forhigh availability. When you use Microsoft Entra Connect to switch the sign-in method from password hash synchronization to Pass-through Authentication, Pass-through Authentication becomes the primary sign-in method for your users in managed domains. All users' password hashes that are previously synchronized by password hash synchronization remain stored on Microsoft Entra ID. Yes. The rebranded versions of the Pass-through Authentication Agent, version 1.5.193.0 or later, support this configuration. For this feature to work, you need version 1.1.750.0 or later for Microsoft Entra Connect and 1.5.193.0 or later for the Pass-through Authentication Agent. Install all the software on servers with Windows Server 2012 R2 or later. This may be due to either the updater service not working correctly or if there are no new updates available that the service can install.
The updater service is healthy if itâ€™s running and there are no errors recorded in the event log (Applications and Services logs -> Microsoft -> AzureADConnect-Agent -> Updater -> Admin). Only major versions are released for auto upgrade. We recommend updating your Agent manually only if it's necessary. For example, you can't wait for a major release, because you must fix a known problem or you want to use a new feature. For more information on new releases, the type of the release (download, auto upgrade), bug fixes, and new features see,Microsoft Entra pass-through authentication agent: Version release history. To manually upgrade a connector: If you've configuredpassword writebackfor a specific user, and if the user signs in by using Pass-through Authentication, they can change or reset their passwords. The passwords are written back to on-premises Active Directory as expected. If you haven't configured password writeback for a specific user or if the user doesn't have a valid Microsoft Entra ID license assigned, the user can't update their password in the cloud. They can't update their password, even if their password expired. The user instead sees this message: ""Your organization doesn't allow you to update your password on this site. Update it according to the method recommended by your organization, or ask your admin if you need help."" The user or the administrator must reset their password in on-premises Active Directory. The password expiry doesn't trigger the revocation of authentication tokens or cookies. Until the tokens or cookies are valid, the user is able to use them. This applies regardless of the authentication type (PTA, PHS, and federated scenarios). For more details please check the following documentation: Microsoft identity platform access tokens - Microsoft identity platform | Microsoft Docs Read information about Smart Lockout. The Authentication Agents make HTTPS requests over port 443 for all feature operations. The Authentication Agents make HTTP requests over port 80 to download the TLS/SSL certificate revocation lists (CRLs). Note Recent updates reduced the number of ports that the feature requires. If you have older versions of Microsoft Entra Connect or the Authentication Agent, keep these ports open as well: 5671, 8080, 9090, 9091, 9350, 9352, and 10100-10120. Yes. If Web Proxy Auto-Discovery (WPAD) is enabled in your on-premises environment, Authentication Agents automatically attempt to locate and use a web proxy server on the network. For more information about using the outbound proxy server, seeWork with existing on-premises proxy servers. If you don't have WPAD in your environment, you can add proxy information to allow a Pass-through Authentication Agent to communicate with Microsoft Entra ID: No, you can only install one Pass-through Authentication Agent on a single server. If you want to configure Pass-through Authentication for high availability,follow the instructions here. The communication between each Pass-through Authentication Agent and Microsoft Entra ID is secured using certificate-based authentication. Thesecertificates are automatically renewed every few months by Microsoft Entra ID. There's no need to manually renew these certificates. You can clean up older expired certificates as required. As long as a Pass-through Authentication Agent is running, it remains active and continually handles user sign-in requests. If you want to uninstall an Authentication Agent, go toControl Panel -> Programs -> Programs and Features. Uninstall both theMicrosoft Entra Connect Authentication Agentand theMicrosoft Entra Connect Agent Updaterprograms. If you check the Pass-through Authentication blade on theMicrosoft Entra admin centeras at least aHybrid Identity Administrator. You should see the Authentication Agent showing asInactive. This isexpected. The Authentication Agent is automatically dropped from the list after 10 days. If you're migrating from AD FS (or other federation technologies) to Pass-through Authentication, we highly recommend that you follow ourquickstart guide. Yes. Multi-forest environments are supported if there are forest trusts (two-way) between your Active Directory forests and if name suffix routing is correctly configured. No, installing multiple Pass-through Authentication Agents ensures onlyhigh availability. It doesn't provide deterministic load balancing between the Authentication Agents. Any Authentication Agent (at random) can process a particular user sign-in request. Installing multiple Pass-through Authentication Agents ensureshigh availability. But, it doesn't provide deterministic load balancing between the Authentication Agents. Consider the peak and average load of sign-in requests that you expect to see on your tenant. As a benchmark, a single Authentication Agent can handle 300 to 400 authentications per second on a standard 4-core CPU, 16-GB RAM server. To estimate network traffic, use the following sizing guidance: For most customers, two or three Authentication Agents in total are sufficient for high availability and capacity. However, in production environments, we recommend that you have a minimum of 3 Authentication Agents running on your tenant. You should install Authentication Agents close to your domain controllers to improve sign-in latency. Note There's a system limit of 40 Authentication Agents per tenant. It's recommended that you enable or disable Pass-through Authentication using aHybrid Identity Administratoraccount. Doing it this way ensures that you don't get locked out of your tenant.
] Rerun the Microsoft Entra Connect wizard and change the user sign-in method from Pass-through Authentication to another method. This change disables Pass-through Authentication on the tenant and uninstalls the Authentication Agent from the server. You must manually uninstall the Authentication Agents from the other servers. If you uninstall a Pass-through Authentication Agent from a server, it causes the server to stop accepting sign-in requests. To avoid breaking the user sign-in capability on your tenant, ensure that you have another Authentication Agent running before you uninstall a Pass-through Authentication Agent. Under the following circumstances your on-premises UPN changes might not synchronize if: This is because the default behavior of tenants created prior to June 15, 2015 was to block UPN changes. If you need to un-block UPN changes you need to run the following PowerShell cmdlet. Get the ID by using theGet-MgDirectoryOnPremiseSynchronizationcmdlet. Tenants created after June 15, 2015 have the default behavior of synchronizing UPN changes. To validate which local server or authentication agent was used for a specific sign-in event: In theMicrosoft Entra admin center, go to the sign-in event. SelectAuthentication Details. In theAuthentication Method Detailcolumn, Agent ID details are shown in the format ""Pass-through Authentication; PTA AgentId: 00001111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-3333cccc4444"". To get Agent ID details for the agent that's installed on your local server, sign-in to your local server and run following cmdlet: Get-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Azure AD Connect Agents\Azure AD Connect Authentication Agent' | Select *Instance* The GUID value that's returned is the Agent ID of the authentication agent that's installed on that specific server. If you have multiple agents in your environment, you can run this cmdlet on each agent server and capture the Agent ID details. Correlate the Agent ID that you get from the local server and from the Microsoft Entra sign-in logs to validate which agent or server acknowledged the sign-request. Microsoft Entra pass-through authentication: Frequently asked questions In this article Which of the methods to sign in to Microsoft Entra ID, Pass-through Authentication, password hash synchronization, and Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) should I choose? Is Pass-through Authentication a free feature? Does Conditional Access work with Pass-through Authentication? Does Pass-through Authentication support ""Alternate ID"" as the username, instead of ""userPrincipalName""? Does password hash synchronization act as a fallback to Pass-through Authentication? What happens when I switch from password hash synchronization to Pass-through Authentication? Can I install a Microsoft Entra private network connector on the same server as a Pass-through Authentication Agent? What versions of Microsoft Entra Connect and Pass-through Authentication Agent do you need? Why is my connector still using an older version and not automatically upgraded to latest version? What happens if my user's password expired and they try to sign in by using Pass-through Authentication? The user signs in to Microsoft Entra ID with credentials (username, password).

How can I publish Remote Desktop Gateway over Microsoft Entra application proxy?,Refer toPublish Remote Desktop with Microsoft Entra application proxy.,"Microsoft Entra ID is a cloud-based identity and access management solution. It's a directory and identity management service that operates in the cloud and offers authentication and authorization services to various Microsoft services, such as Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and Microsoft Azure. For more information, seeWhat is Microsoft Entra ID? To access the Microsoft Entra admin center or the Azure portal, each user needs permissions with a valid subscription. If you don't have a paid Microsoft 365 or Microsoft Entra subscription, you need to activate a freeMicrosoft Entra Accountor establish a paid subscription. All Azure subscriptions, whether paid or free, have a trust relationship with a Microsoft Entra tenant. All subscriptions rely on the Microsoft Entra tenant (directory) to authenticate and authorize security principals and devices. For more information, seeHow Azure subscriptions are associated with Microsoft Entra ID. Microsoft Entra ID provides you with common identity and access capabilities to all web services. Whether you're using Microsoft services, such as Microsoft 365, Power Platform, Dynamics 365, or other Microsoft products, you're already using Microsoft Entra ID to help turn on sign-on and access management for all cloud services. All users who are set up to use Microsoft services are defined as user accounts in one or more Microsoft Entra instances, providing these accounts access to Microsoft Entra ID. For more information, seeMicrosoft Entra ID Plans & Pricing Microsoft Entra paid services, such as Enterprise Mobility + Security (Microsoft Enterprise Mobility + Security) complement other Microsoft services like Microsoft 365, with comprehensive enterprise-scale development, management, and security solutions. For more information, see TheMicrosoft Cloud. By default, the person who signs up for a Microsoft Entra or Azure subscription is assigned the Owner role for Azure resources. An Owner can use either a Microsoft account or a work or school account from the directory that the Microsoft Entra or Azure subscription is associated with. This role is also authorized to manage services in the Azure portal. If others need to sign in and access services by using the same subscription, you can assign them the appropriatebuilt-in role. For more information, seeAssign Azure roles using the Azure portal. By default, the user who creates a Microsoft Entra tenant is automatically assigned theGlobal Administratorrole. This user has access to all Microsoft Entra directory features. Microsoft Entra ID has a different set of administrator roles to manage the directory and identity-related features. These administrators have access to various features in the Azure portal. The administrator's role determines what they can do, like create or edit users, assign administrative roles to others, reset user passwords, manage user licenses, or manage domains. For more information, seeAssign a user to administrator roles in Microsoft Entra IDandAssigning administrator roles in Microsoft Entra ID. No.  This isn't currently available. To optimize connectivity between your network and the Microsoft Entra admin center and its services, you might want to add specific Microsoft Entra admin center URLs to your allowlist. Doing so can improve performance and connectivity between your local- or wide area network. Network administrators often deploy proxy servers, firewalls, or other devices, which can help secure and give control over how users access the internet. Rules designed to protect users can sometimes block or slow down legitimate business-related internet traffic. This traffic includes communications between you and Microsoft Entra admin center over the following URLs: For more information, seeUsing Microsoft Entra application proxy to publish on-premises apps for remote users. Additional URLs that you should include are listed in the articleAllow the Azure portal URLs on your firewall or proxy server. You can usually leave an organization on your own without having to contact an administrator. However, in some cases this option isn't available and you need to contact your tenant admin, who can delete your account in the external organization. For more information, seeLeave an organization as an external user. You can connect your on-premises directory to Microsoft Entra ID by using Microsoft Entra Connect. For more information, seeIntegrating your on-premises identities with Microsoft Entra ID. You only need to set up single sign-on (SSO) between your on-premises directory and Microsoft Entra ID. As long as you access your cloud applications through Microsoft Entra ID, the service automatically drives your users to correctly authenticate with their on-premises credentials. Implementing SSO from on-premises can be easily achieved with federation solutions such as Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), or by configuring password hash sync. You can easily deploy both options by using the Microsoft Entra Connect configuration wizard. For more information, seeIntegrating your on-premises identities with Microsoft Entra ID. Yes, Microsoft Entra ID provides you with theMicrosoft Entra ID Access Panelfor user self-service and application access. If you're a Microsoft 365 customer, you can find many of the same capabilities in theOffice 365 portal. For more information, seeIntroduction to the Access Panel. Yes. The Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 edition provides you with Microsoft Entra Connect Health. Microsoft Entra Connect Health helps you monitor and gain insight into your on-premises identity infrastructure and the synchronization services. For more information, seeMonitor your on-premises identity infrastructure and synchronization services in the cloud. (For example, is it possible to use Microsoft Entra self-service password reset (SSPR) with password write-back and not store passwords in the cloud?) This example scenario doesn't require the on-premises password to be tracked in Microsoft Entra. This is because you don't need to synchronize your Active Directory passwords to Microsoft Entra ID to enable write-back. In a federated environment, Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) relies on the on-premises directory to authenticate the user. Password write-back operates in real time. For more information, seeGetting started with password management. Yes, if you have password write-back enabled, the password operations performed by an admin are written back to your on-premises environment. For more answers to password-related questions, seePassword management frequently asked questions. There are a couple of options. You can use the self-service password reset (SSPR) if it's available. Whether SSPR works depends on how it's configured.  For more information about resetting Microsoft Entra passwords, seeHow does the password reset portal work. For Microsoft 365 users, your admin can reset the password by using the steps outlined inReset user passwords. For Microsoft Entra accounts, admins can reset passwords by using one of the following: Microsoft Entra ID uses a more sophisticated strategy to lock accounts. This is based on the IP of the request and the passwords entered. The duration of the lockout also increases based on the likelihood that it's an attack. Rejected passwords return the message 'This password has been used too many times'. This refers to passwords that are globally common, such as any variants of ""Password"" and ""123456"". We do have a gateway that filters requests and provides some protection from botnets, and is applied for all B2C tenants. Microsoft Entra ID has more than 2,600 pre-integrated applications from Microsoft, application service providers, and partners. All pre-integrated applications support single sign-on (SSO). SSO lets you use your organizational credentials to access your apps. Some of the applications also support automated provisioning and de-provisioning. For a complete list of the pre-integrated applications, see theAzure Marketplace. With Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2, you can add and configure any application that you want. Depending on your application's capabilities and your preferences, you can configure SSO and automated provisioning. For more information, seeSingle sign-on SAML protocolandDevelop and plan provisioning for a SCIM endpoint. Microsoft Entra ID provides several ways for users to view and access their applications, such as: For more information, seeEnd user experiences for applications. Microsoft Entra ID supports many standardized protocols for authentication and authorization, such as SAML 2.0, OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, and WS-Federation. Microsoft Entra ID also supports password vaulting and automated sign-in capabilities for apps that only support forms-based authentication. For more information, seeIdentity fundamentalsandSingle sign-on for applications in Microsoft Entra ID. Microsoft Entra application proxyprovides you with easy and secure access to on-premises web applications that you choose. You can access these applications in the same way that you access your software as a service (SaaS) apps in Microsoft Entra ID. There's no need for a VPN or to change your network infrastructure. For more information, seeHow to provide secure remote access to on-premises applications. WithMicrosoft Entra Conditional Access, you can assign a unique access policy for each application. In your policy, you can require multifactor authentication always, or when users aren't connected to the local network.

Can I use Kerberos Constrained Delegation (single sign-on - Windows Integrated Authentication) in the Remote Desktop Gateway publishing scenario?,"No, this scenario isn't supported.","Windows Hello for Business replaces password sign-in with strong authentication, using an asymmetric key pair. This Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) article is intended to help you learn more about Windows Hello for Business. Windows Hellois an authentication technology that allows users to sign in to their Windows devices using biometric data, or a PIN, instead of a traditional password. Windows Hello for Businessis an extension of Windows Hello that provides enterprise-grade security and management capabilities, including device attestation, certificate-based authentication, and conditional access policies. Policy settings can be deployed to devices to ensure they're secure and compliant with organizational requirements. Three main reasons: The statementA PIN is stronger than a passwordis not directed at the strength of the entropy used by the PIN. It's about the difference between providing entropy versus continuing the use of a symmetric key (the password). The TPM has anti-hammering features that thwart brute-force PIN attacks (an attacker's continuous attempt to try all combination of PINs). Some organizations may worry about shoulder surfing. For those organizations, rather than increase the complexity of the PIN, implement theMultifactor Unlockfeature. To compromise a Windows Hello credential that TPM protects, an attacker must have access to the physical device. Then, the attacker must find a way to spoof the user's biometrics or guess the PIN. All these actions must be done beforeTPM anti-hammeringprotection locks the device. Windows Hello enables biometric sign-in with fingerprint, iris, or facial recognition. When you set up Windows Hello, you're asked to create a PIN after the biometric setup. The PIN enables you to sign in when you can't use your preferred biometric because of an injury or because the sensor is unavailable or not working properly.
If you only had a biometric sign-in configured and, for any reason, were unable to use that method to sign in, you would have to sign in using your account and password, which doesn't provide you with the same level of protection as Hello. Anytime key material is generated, it must be protected against attack. The most robust way to do this is through specialized hardware. There's a long history of using hardware security modules (HSMs) to generate, store, and process keys for security-critical applications. Smart cards are a special type of HSM, as are devices that are compliant with the Trusted Computing Group TPM standard. Wherever possible, the Windows Hello for Business implementation takes advantage of onboard TPM hardware to generate and protect keys. Administrators can choose to allow key operations in software, but it's recommended the use of TPM hardware. The TPM protects against a variety of known and potential attacks, including PIN brute-force attacks. The TPM provides an additional layer of protection after an account lockout, too. When the TPM has locked the key material, the user will have to reset the PIN (which means the user will have to use MFA to reauthenticate to the IdP before the IdP allows re-registration). Resetting the PIN means that all keys and certificates encrypted with the old key material will be removed. Windows Hello for Business provides a PIN caching user experience by using a ticketing system. Rather than caching a PIN, processes cache a ticket they can use to request private key operations. Microsoft Entra ID and Active Directory sign-in keys are cached under lock. This means the keys remain available for use without prompting, as long as the user is interactively signed-in. Microsoft Account sign-in keys are transactional keys, which means the user is always prompted when accessing the key. Windows Hello for Business used as a smart card (smart card emulation that is enabled by default) provides the same user experience of default smart card PIN caching. Each process requesting a private key operation prompts the user for the PIN on first use. Subsequent private key operations won't prompt the user for the PIN. The smart card emulation feature of Windows Hello for Business verifies the PIN and then discards the PIN in exchange for a ticket. The process doesn't receive the PIN, but rather the ticket that grants them private key operations. There isn't a policy setting to adjust the caching. When you enroll in Windows Hello, a representation of your biometrics, called an enrollment profile, is created. The enrollment profile biometrics data is device specific, is stored locally on the device, and does not leave the device or roam with the user. Some external fingerprint sensors store biometric data on the fingerprint module itself rather than on Windows device. Even in this case, the biometrics data is stored locally on those modules, is device specific, doesn't roam, never leaves the module, and is never sent to Microsoft cloud or external server. For more details, seeWindows Hello biometrics in the enterpriseandWindows Hello face authentication. Windows Hello biometrics data is stored on the device as an encrypted template database. The data from the biometrics sensor (like face camera or fingerprint reader) creates a data representationâ€”or graphâ€”that is then encrypted before it's stored on the device. Each biometrics sensor on the device which is used by Windows Hello (face or fingerprint) will have its own biometric database file where template data is stored. Each biometrics database file is encrypted with unique, randomly generated key that is encrypted to the system using AES encryption producing an SHA256 hash. Since Windows Hello biometrics data is stored in encrypted format, no user, or any process other than Windows Hello has access to it. Windows Hello biometrics template database file is created on the device only when a user is enrolled into Windows Hello biometrics-based authentication. An IT administrator may configure policy settings, but it's always a user's choice if they want to use biometrics or PIN. Users can check their current enrollment into Windows Hello biometrics by going to sign-in options on their device. Go toStart > Settings > Accounts > Sign-inoptions. If you don't see Windows Hello in Sign-in options, then it may not be available for your device or blocked by admin via policy. Admins can request users to enroll into Windows Hello during Autopilot or during the initial setup of the device. Admins can disallow users to enroll into biometrics via Windows Hello for Business policy configurations. However, when allowed via policy configurations, enrollment into Windows Hello biometrics is always optional for users. To remove Windows Hello and any associated biometric identification data from the device, openStart > Settings > Accounts > Sign-in options. Select the Windows Hello biometrics authentication method you want to remove, and then selectRemove. The action unenrolls from Windows Hello biometrics authentication and deletes the associated biometrics template database file. For more details, seeWindows sign-in options and account protection (microsoft.com). Starting in Configuration Manager, version 2203, Windows Hello for Business deployments using Configuration Manager are no longer supported. You can delete the Windows Hello for Business container by executing the commandcertutil.exe -deleteHelloContainer. If the user can sign in with a password, they can reset their PIN by selecting theI forgot my PINlink in the Settings app or from the lock screen, by selecting theI forgot my PINlink on the PIN credential provider. For on-premises deployments, devices must be connected to their on-premises network (domain controllers and/or certificate authority) to reset their PINs. Hybrid deployments can onboard their Microsoft Entra tenant to use theWindows Hello for Business PIN reset serviceto reset their PINs. Non-destructive PIN reset works without access to the corporate network. Destructive PIN reset requires access to the corporate network. For more details about destructive and non-destructive PIN reset, seePIN reset. Yes. Our simple PIN algorithm looks for and disallows any PIN that has a constant delta from one digit to the next. The algorithm counts the number of steps required to reach the next digit, overflowing at 10 ('zero').
So, for example: This check prevents repeating numbers, sequential numbers, and simple patterns. It always results in a list of 100 disallowed PINs (independent of the PIN length). This algorithm doesn't apply to alphanumeric PINs. To help Microsoft keep things working properly, to help detecting and preventing fraud, and to continue improving Windows Hello, diagnostic data about how people use Windows Hello is collected. For example: No. The movement away from passwords is accomplished by gradually reducing the use of the password. In situations where you can't authenticate by using biometrics, you need a fallback mechanism that isn't a password. The PIN is the fallback mechanism. Disabling or hiding the PIN credential provider will disable the use of biometrics. The unauthorized user won't be able to utilize any biometric options and will have the only option to enter a PIN. If the user attempts to unlock the device by entering random PINs, after three unsuccessful attempts the credential provider will display the following message:You've entered an incorrect PIN several times. To try again, enter A1B2C3 below.
Upon entering the challenge phraseA1B2C3, the user will be granted one more opportunity to enter the PIN. If unsuccessful, the provider will be disabled, leaving the user with the only option to reboot the device. Following the reboot, the aforementioned pattern repeats. If unsuccessful attempts continue, the device will enter a lockout state, lasting for 1 minute after the first reboot, 2 minutes after the fourth reboot, and 10 minutes after the fifth reboot. The duration of each lockout increases accordingly. This behavior is a result of the TPM 2.0 anti-hammering feature.
For more information about the TPM anti-hammering feature, seeTPM 2.0 anti-hammering. Yes. You can use the on-premises Windows Hello for Business deployment and combine it with a non-Microsoft MFA provider that doesn't require internet connectivity to achieve an air-gapped Windows Hello for Business deployment. The maximum number of supported enrollments on a single device is 10. This lets 10 users each enroll their face and up to 10 fingerprints. For devices with more than 10 users, or for users that sign-in to many devices (for example, a support technician), it's recommended the use of FIDO2 security keys. No. If your organization is using Microsoft cloud services, then you must use a hybrid deployment model. On-premises deployments are exclusive to organizations who need more time before moving to the cloud and exclusively use Active Directory. ReviewMicrosoft Entra Connect Sync: Attributes synchronized to Microsoft Entra IDfor a list of attributes that sync based on scenarios. The base scenarios that include Windows Hello for Business are theWindows 10scenario and theDevice writebackscenario. Your environment may include other attributes. Yes, if you're using federated hybrid deployment, you can use any non-Microsoft that provides an AD FS MFA adapter. A list of non-Microsoft MFA adapters can be foundhere. Windows Hello for Business works with any non-Microsoft federation servers that support the protocols used during the provisioning experience. Windows Hello for Business is not designed to work with local accounts. ReadWindows Hello biometric requirementsfor more information. Wearing a mask to enroll is a security concern because other users wearing a similar mask may be able to unlock your device. Remove a mask if you're wearing one when you enroll or unlock with Windows Hello face authentication. If your working environment doesn't allow you to remove a mask temporarily, consider un-enrolling from face authentication and only using PIN or fingerprint. A user will be prompted to set up a Windows Hello for Business key on a Microsoft Entra registered devices if the feature is enabled by policy. If the user has an existing Windows Hello container, the Windows Hello for Business key will be enrolled in that container and will be protected using existing gestures. If a user has signed into their Microsoft Entra registered device with Windows Hello, their Windows Hello for Business key will be used to authenticate the user's work identity when they try to use Microsoft Entra resources. The Windows Hello for Business key meets Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication (MFA) requirements and reduces the number of MFA prompts users will see when accessing resources. It's possible to Microsoft Entra register a domain joined device. If the domain joined device has a convenience PIN, sign in with the convenience PIN will no longer work. This configuration isn't supported by Windows Hello for Business. For more information, seeMicrosoft Entra registered devices. Windows Hello for Business is a feature of the Windows platform. No, Microsoft Entra Domain Services is a separately managed environment in Azure, and hybrid device registration with cloud Microsoft Entra ID isn't available for it via Microsoft Entra Connect. Hence, Windows Hello for Business doesn't work with Microsoft Entra Domain Services. Windows Hello for Business is two-factor authentication based on the observed authentication factors of:something you have,something you know, andsomething that's part of you. Windows Hello for Business incorporates two of these factors: something you have (the user's private key protected by the device's security module) and something you know (your PIN). With the proper hardware, you can enhance the user experience by introducing biometrics. By using biometrics, you can replace the ""something you know"" authentication factor with the ""something that is part of you"" factor, with the assurances that users can fall back to the ""something you know factor"". Note The Windows Hello for Business key meets Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication (MFA) requirements and reduces the number of MFA prompts users will see when accessing resources. For more information, seeWhat is a Primary Refresh Token. Both types of authentication provide the same security; one is not more secure than the other.
The trust models of your deployment determine how you authenticate to Active Directory. Both key trust and certificate trust use the same hardware-backed, two-factor credential. The difference between the two trust types is the issuance of end-entity certificates: Convenience PINprovides a simpler way to sign in to Windows than passwords, but it still uses a password for authentication. When the correct convenience PIN is provided to Windows, the password information is loaded from its cache and authenticates the user. Organizations using convenience PINs should move toWindows Hello for Business. New Windows deployments should deploy Windows Hello for Business and not convenience PINs. No. While it's possible to set a convenience PIN on Microsoft Entra joined and Microsoft Entra hybrid joined devices, convenience PIN isn't supported for Microsoft Entra user accounts (including synchronized identities). Convenience PIN is only supported for on-premises Active Directory users and local account users. Windows Hello for Business is the modern, two-factor authentication for Windows. Customers using virtual smart cards are strongly encouraged to move to Windows Hello for Business. For a list of required URLs, seeMicrosoft 365 Common and Office Online. If your environment uses Microsoft Intune, seeNetwork endpoints for Microsoft Intune. Yes, you can use an external Windows Hello compatible camera if a device has an internal Windows Hello camera. When both cameras are present, the external camera is used for face authentication. For more information, seeIT tools to support Windows 10, version 21H1. If ESS is enabled, seeWindows Hello Enhanced Sign-in Security. Some laptops and tablets with keyboards that close may not use an external Windows Hello compatible camera or other Windows Hello compatible accessory when the computer is docked with the lid closed. The issue has been addressed in Windows 11, version 22H2. Windows Hello for Business credentials need access to device state, which is not available in private browser mode or incognito mode. Hence it can't be used in private browser or Incognito mode. You can usemultifactor unlockto require users to provide an extra factor to unlock their device. Authentication remains two-factor, but another factor is required before Windows allows the user to reach the desktop. To learn more, seeMultifactor Unlock. Windows Hello for Businesscloud Kerberos trustis atrust modelthat enables Windows Hello for Business deployment using the infrastructure introduced for supportingsecurity key sign-in on Microsoft Entra hybrid joined devices and on-premises resource access on Microsoft Entra joined devices. Cloud Kerberos trust is the preferred deployment model if you do not need to support certificate authentication scenarios. For more information, seecloud Kerberos trust deployment. This feature doesn't work in a pure on-premises AD domain services environment. Windows Hello for Business cloud Kerberos trust functions correctly when the client authenticates directly to a writable domain controller or to a Read-Only Domain Controller (RODC) that doesn't cache the user's credentials, in accordance with the Password Replication Policy. If the client attempts to authenticate to an RODC that can cache the user's credentials, cloud Kerberos trust authentication might fail. To mitigate this, deploy KDC certificates to all RODCs to support Windows Hello for Business key trust authentication, which is also required for those RODCs to support LDAP over SSL. This configuration ensures that authentication can seamlessly failover to Windows Hello for Business key trust authentication, thereby guaranteeing successful user authentication. Windows Hello for Business cloud Kerberos trust requires line of sight to a domain controller when: Windows Hello for Business cloud Kerberos trust can't be used as a supplied credential with RDP/VDI. Similar to key trust, cloud Kerberos trust can be used for RDP if acertificate is enrolled into Windows Hello for Businessfor this purpose. As an alternative, consider usingRemote Credential Guardwhich doesn't require to deploy certificates. No, only the number necessary to handle the load from all cloud Kerberos trust devices. In a hybrid deployment, a user's public key must sync from Microsoft Entra ID to Active Directory before it can be used to authenticate against a domain controller. This sync is handled by Microsoft Entra Connect and will occur during a normal sync cycle. Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) doesn't support using key-based authentication as supplied credentials. However, you can deploy certificates in the key trust model to enable RDP. For more information, seeDeploying certificates to key trust users to enable RDP.

No. Both GIF and PNG are raster (or bit-mapped) formats that can be used to store vector graphics. Raster formats store every pixel, whereas vector formats such as VML use mathematical descriptions or outlines to describe the graphics. Vector graphics stored in a vector-based format are more compact than those stored in raster formats, resulting in faster download times for Web users. In addition, VML graphics are delivered inline to the HTML page rather than relying on external files, as is the case with GIF and PNG today. This allows VML graphics to scale and interact with other Web page elements as the page is resized, thus improving the end-user experience.

It's a directory and identity management service that operates in the cloud and offers authentication and authorization services to various Microsoft services, such as Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and Microsoft Azure. For more information, seeWhat is Microsoft Entra ID? To access the Microsoft Entra admin center or the Azure portal, each user needs permissions with a valid subscription. If you don't have a paid Microsoft 365 or Microsoft Entra subscription, you need to activate a freeMicrosoft Entra Accountor establish a paid subscription. All Azure subscriptions, whether paid or free, have a trust relationship with a Microsoft Entra tenant. All subscriptions rely on the Microsoft Entra tenant (directory) to authenticate and authorize security principals and devices. For more information, seeHow Azure subscriptions are associated with Microsoft Entra ID. Microsoft Entra ID provides you with common identity and access capabilities to all web services. Whether you're using Microsoft services, such as Microsoft 365, Power Platform, Dynamics 365, or other Microsoft products, you're already using Microsoft Entra ID to help turn on sign-on and access management for all cloud services. All users who are set up to use Microsoft services are defined as user accounts in one or more Microsoft Entra instances, providing these accounts access to Microsoft Entra ID. For more information, seeMicrosoft Entra ID Plans & Pricing Microsoft Entra paid services, such as Enterprise Mobility + Security (Microsoft Enterprise Mobility + Security) complement other Microsoft services like Microsoft 365, with comprehensive enterprise-scale development, management, and security solutions. For more information, see TheMicrosoft Cloud. By default, the person who signs up for a Microsoft Entra or Azure subscription is assigned the Owner role for Azure resources. An Owner can use either a Microsoft account or a work or school account from the directory that the Microsoft Entra or Azure subscription is associated with. This role is also authorized to manage services in the Azure portal. If others need to sign in and access services by using the same subscription, you can assign them the appropriatebuilt-in role. For more information, seeAssign Azure roles using the Azure portal. By default, the user who creates a Microsoft Entra tenant is automatically assigned theGlobal Administratorrole. This user has access to all Microsoft Entra directory features. Microsoft Entra ID has a different set of administrator roles to manage the directory and identity-related features. These administrators have access to various features in the Azure portal. The administrator's role determines what they can do, like create or edit users, assign administrative roles to others, reset user passwords, manage user licenses, or manage domains. For more information, seeAssign a user to administrator roles in Microsoft Entra IDandAssigning administrator roles in Microsoft Entra ID. No.  This isn't currently available. To optimize connectivity between your network and the Microsoft Entra admin center and its services, you might want to add specific Microsoft Entra admin center URLs to your allowlist. Doing so can improve performance and connectivity between your local- or wide area network. Network administrators often deploy proxy servers, firewalls, or other devices, which can help secure and give control over how users access the internet. Rules designed to protect users can sometimes block or slow down legitimate business-related internet traffic. This traffic includes communications between you and Microsoft Entra admin center over the following URLs: For more information, seeUsing Microsoft Entra application proxy to publish on-premises apps for remote users. Additional URLs that you should include are listed in the articleAllow the Azure portal URLs on your firewall or proxy server. You can usually leave an organization on your own without having to contact an administrator. However, in some cases this option isn't available and you need to contact your tenant admin, who can delete your account in the external organization. For more information, seeLeave an organization as an external user. You can connect your on-premises directory to Microsoft Entra ID by using Microsoft Entra Connect. For more information, seeIntegrating your on-premises identities with Microsoft Entra ID. You only need to set up single sign-on (SSO) between your on-premises directory and Microsoft Entra ID. As long as you access your cloud applications through Microsoft Entra ID, the service automatically drives your users to correctly authenticate with their on-premises credentials. Implementing SSO from on-premises can be easily achieved with federation solutions such as Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), or by configuring password hash sync. You can easily deploy both options by using the Microsoft Entra Connect configuration wizard. For more information, seeIntegrating your on-premises identities with Microsoft Entra ID. Yes, Microsoft Entra ID provides you with theMicrosoft Entra ID Access Panelfor user self-service and application access.

(For example, is it possible to use Microsoft Entra self-service password reset (SSPR) with password write-back and not store passwords in the cloud?) This example scenario doesn't require the on-premises password to be tracked in Microsoft Entra. This is because you don't need to synchronize your Active Directory passwords to Microsoft Entra ID to enable write-back. In a federated environment, Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) relies on the on-premises directory to authenticate the user. Password write-back operates in real time. For more information, seeGetting started with password management. Yes, if you have password write-back enabled, the password operations performed by an admin are written back to your on-premises environment. For more answers to password-related questions, seePassword management frequently asked questions. There are a couple of options. You can use the self-service password reset (SSPR) if it's available. Whether SSPR works depends on how it's configured.  For more information about resetting Microsoft Entra passwords, seeHow does the password reset portal work. For Microsoft 365 users, your admin can reset the password by using the steps outlined inReset user passwords. For Microsoft Entra accounts, admins can reset passwords by using one of the following: Microsoft Entra ID uses a more sophisticated strategy to lock accounts. This is based on the IP of the request and the passwords entered. The duration of the lockout also increases based on the likelihood that it's an attack. Rejected passwords return the message 'This password has been used too many times'. This refers to passwords that are globally common, such as any variants of ""Password"" and ""123456"". We do have a gateway that filters requests and provides some protection from botnets, and is applied for all B2C tenants. Microsoft Entra ID has more than 2,600 pre-integrated applications from Microsoft, application service providers, and partners. All pre-integrated applications support single sign-on (SSO). SSO lets you use your organizational credentials to access your apps. Some of the applications also support automated provisioning and de-provisioning. For a complete list of the pre-integrated applications, see theAzure Marketplace. With Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2, you can add and configure any application that you want. Depending on your application's capabilities and your preferences, you can configure SSO and automated provisioning.

That's why the scenario doesn't work.","Windows Hello for Business replaces password sign-in with strong authentication, using an asymmetric key pair. This Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) article is intended to help you learn more about Windows Hello for Business. Windows Hellois an authentication technology that allows users to sign in to their Windows devices using biometric data, or a PIN, instead of a traditional password. Windows Hello for Businessis an extension of Windows Hello that provides enterprise-grade security and management capabilities, including device attestation, certificate-based authentication, and conditional access policies. Policy settings can be deployed to devices to ensure they're secure and compliant with organizational requirements. Three main reasons: The statementA PIN is stronger than a passwordis not directed at the strength of the entropy used by the PIN. It's about the difference between providing entropy versus continuing the use of a symmetric key (the password). The TPM has anti-hammering features that thwart brute-force PIN attacks (an attacker's continuous attempt to try all combination of PINs). Some organizations may worry about shoulder surfing. For those organizations, rather than increase the complexity of the PIN, implement theMultifactor Unlockfeature. To compromise a Windows Hello credential that TPM protects, an attacker must have access to the physical device. Then, the attacker must find a way to spoof the user's biometrics or guess the PIN. All these actions must be done beforeTPM anti-hammeringprotection locks the device. Windows Hello enables biometric sign-in with fingerprint, iris, or facial recognition. When you set up Windows Hello, you're asked to create a PIN after the biometric setup. The PIN enables you to sign in when you can't use your preferred biometric because of an injury or because the sensor is unavailable or not working properly.
If you only had a biometric sign-in configured and, for any reason, were unable to use that method to sign in, you would have to sign in using your account and password, which doesn't provide you with the same level of protection as Hello. Anytime key material is generated, it must be protected against attack. The most robust way to do this is through specialized hardware. There's a long history of using hardware security modules (HSMs) to generate, store, and process keys for security-critical applications. Smart cards are a special type of HSM, as are devices that are compliant with the Trusted Computing Group TPM standard. Wherever possible, the Windows Hello for Business implementation takes advantage of onboard TPM hardware to generate and protect keys. Administrators can choose to allow key operations in software, but it's recommended the use of TPM hardware. The TPM protects against a variety of known and potential attacks, including PIN brute-force attacks. The TPM provides an additional layer of protection after an account lockout, too. When the TPM has locked the key material, the user will have to reset the PIN (which means the user will have to use MFA to reauthenticate to the IdP before the IdP allows re-registration). Resetting the PIN means that all keys and certificates encrypted with the old key material will be removed. Windows Hello for Business provides a PIN caching user experience by using a ticketing system. Rather than caching a PIN, processes cache a ticket they can use to request private key operations. Microsoft Entra ID and Active Directory sign-in keys are cached under lock. This means the keys remain available for use without prompting, as long as the user is interactively signed-in. Microsoft Account sign-in keys are transactional keys, which means the user is always prompted when accessing the key. Windows Hello for Business used as a smart card (smart card emulation that is enabled by default) provides the same user experience of default smart card PIN caching. Each process requesting a private key operation prompts the user for the PIN on first use. Subsequent private key operations won't prompt the user for the PIN. The smart card emulation feature of Windows Hello for Business verifies the PIN and then discards the PIN in exchange for a ticket. The process doesn't receive the PIN, but rather the ticket that grants them private key operations. There isn't a policy setting to adjust the caching. When you enroll in Windows Hello, a representation of your biometrics, called an enrollment profile, is created. The enrollment profile biometrics data is device specific, is stored locally on the device, and does not leave the device or roam with the user. Some external fingerprint sensors store biometric data on the fingerprint module itself rather than on Windows device. Even in this case, the biometrics data is stored locally on those modules, is device specific, doesn't roam, never leaves the module, and is never sent to Microsoft cloud or external server. For more details, seeWindows Hello biometrics in the enterpriseandWindows Hello face authentication. Windows Hello biometrics data is stored on the device as an encrypted template database. The data from the biometrics sensor (like face camera or fingerprint reader) creates a data representationâ€”or graphâ€”that is then encrypted before it's stored on the device. Each biometrics sensor on the device which is used by Windows Hello (face or fingerprint) will have its own biometric database file where template data is stored. Each biometrics database file is encrypted with unique, randomly generated key that is encrypted to the system using AES encryption producing an SHA256 hash. Since Windows Hello biometrics data is stored in encrypted format, no user, or any process other than Windows Hello has access to it. Windows Hello biometrics template database file is created on the device only when a user is enrolled into Windows Hello biometrics-based authentication. An IT administrator may configure policy settings, but it's always a user's choice if they want to use biometrics or PIN. Users can check their current enrollment into Windows Hello biometrics by going to sign-in options on their device. Go toStart > Settings > Accounts > Sign-inoptions. If you don't see Windows Hello in Sign-in options, then it may not be available for your device or blocked by admin via policy. Admins can request users to enroll into Windows Hello during Autopilot or during the initial setup of the device. Admins can disallow users to enroll into biometrics via Windows Hello for Business policy configurations. However, when allowed via policy configurations, enrollment into Windows Hello biometrics is always optional for users. To remove Windows Hello and any associated biometric identification data from the device, openStart > Settings > Accounts > Sign-in options. Select the Windows Hello biometrics authentication method you want to remove, and then selectRemove. The action unenrolls from Windows Hello biometrics authentication and deletes the associated biometrics template database file. For more details, seeWindows sign-in options and account protection (microsoft.com). Starting in Configuration Manager, version 2203, Windows Hello for Business deployments using Configuration Manager are no longer supported. You can delete the Windows Hello for Business container by executing the commandcertutil.exe -deleteHelloContainer. If the user can sign in with a password, they can reset their PIN by selecting theI forgot my PINlink in the Settings app or from the lock screen, by selecting theI forgot my PINlink on the PIN credential provider. For on-premises deployments, devices must be connected to their on-premises network (domain controllers and/or certificate authority) to reset their PINs. Hybrid deployments can onboard their Microsoft Entra tenant to use theWindows Hello for Business PIN reset serviceto reset their PINs. Non-destructive PIN reset works without access to the corporate network. Destructive PIN reset requires access to the corporate network. For more details about destructive and non-destructive PIN reset, seePIN reset. Yes. Our simple PIN algorithm looks for and disallows any PIN that has a constant delta from one digit to the next. The algorithm counts the number of steps required to reach the next digit, overflowing at 10 ('zero').
So, for example: This check prevents repeating numbers, sequential numbers, and simple patterns. It always results in a list of 100 disallowed PINs (independent of the PIN length). This algorithm doesn't apply to alphanumeric PINs. To help Microsoft keep things working properly, to help detecting and preventing fraud, and to continue improving Windows Hello, diagnostic data about how people use Windows Hello is collected. For example: No. The movement away from passwords is accomplished by gradually reducing the use of the password. In situations where you can't authenticate by using biometrics, you need a fallback mechanism that isn't a password. The PIN is the fallback mechanism. Disabling or hiding the PIN credential provider will disable the use of biometrics. The unauthorized user won't be able to utilize any biometric options and will have the only option to enter a PIN. If the user attempts to unlock the device by entering random PINs, after three unsuccessful attempts the credential provider will display the following message:You've entered an incorrect PIN several times. To try again, enter A1B2C3 below.
Upon entering the challenge phraseA1B2C3, the user will be granted one more opportunity to enter the PIN. If unsuccessful, the provider will be disabled, leaving the user with the only option to reboot the device. Following the reboot, the aforementioned pattern repeats. If unsuccessful attempts continue, the device will enter a lockout state, lasting for 1 minute after the first reboot, 2 minutes after the fourth reboot, and 10 minutes after the fifth reboot. The duration of each lockout increases accordingly. This behavior is a result of the TPM 2.0 anti-hammering feature.
For more information about the TPM anti-hammering feature, seeTPM 2.0 anti-hammering. Yes. You can use the on-premises Windows Hello for Business deployment and combine it with a non-Microsoft MFA provider that doesn't require internet connectivity to achieve an air-gapped Windows Hello for Business deployment. The maximum number of supported enrollments on a single device is 10. This lets 10 users each enroll their face and up to 10 fingerprints. For devices with more than 10 users, or for users that sign-in to many devices (for example, a support technician), it's recommended the use of FIDO2 security keys. No. If your organization is using Microsoft cloud services, then you must use a hybrid deployment model. On-premises deployments are exclusive to organizations who need more time before moving to the cloud and exclusively use Active Directory. ReviewMicrosoft Entra Connect Sync: Attributes synchronized to Microsoft Entra IDfor a list of attributes that sync based on scenarios. The base scenarios that include Windows Hello for Business are theWindows 10scenario and theDevice writebackscenario. Your environment may include other attributes. Yes, if you're using federated hybrid deployment, you can use any non-Microsoft that provides an AD FS MFA adapter. A list of non-Microsoft MFA adapters can be foundhere. Windows Hello for Business works with any non-Microsoft federation servers that support the protocols used during the provisioning experience. Windows Hello for Business is not designed to work with local accounts. ReadWindows Hello biometric requirementsfor more information. Wearing a mask to enroll is a security concern because other users wearing a similar mask may be able to unlock your device. Remove a mask if you're wearing one when you enroll or unlock with Windows Hello face authentication. If your working environment doesn't allow you to remove a mask temporarily, consider un-enrolling from face authentication and only using PIN or fingerprint. A user will be prompted to set up a Windows Hello for Business key on a Microsoft Entra registered devices if the feature is enabled by policy. If the user has an existing Windows Hello container, the Windows Hello for Business key will be enrolled in that container and will be protected using existing gestures. If a user has signed into their Microsoft Entra registered device with Windows Hello, their Windows Hello for Business key will be used to authenticate the user's work identity when they try to use Microsoft Entra resources. The Windows Hello for Business key meets Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication (MFA) requirements and reduces the number of MFA prompts users will see when accessing resources. It's possible to Microsoft Entra register a domain joined device. If the domain joined device has a convenience PIN, sign in with the convenience PIN will no longer work. This configuration isn't supported by Windows Hello for Business. For more information, seeMicrosoft Entra registered devices. Windows Hello for Business is a feature of the Windows platform. No, Microsoft Entra Domain Services is a separately managed environment in Azure, and hybrid device registration with cloud Microsoft Entra ID isn't available for it via Microsoft Entra Connect. Hence, Windows Hello for Business doesn't work with Microsoft Entra Domain Services. Windows Hello for Business is two-factor authentication based on the observed authentication factors of:something you have,something you know, andsomething that's part of you. Windows Hello for Business incorporates two of these factors: something you have (the user's private key protected by the device's security module) and something you know (your PIN). With the proper hardware, you can enhance the user experience by introducing biometrics. By using biometrics, you can replace the ""something you know"" authentication factor with the ""something that is part of you"" factor, with the assurances that users can fall back to the ""something you know factor"". Note The Windows Hello for Business key meets Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication (MFA) requirements and reduces the number of MFA prompts users will see when accessing resources. For more information, seeWhat is a Primary Refresh Token. Both types of authentication provide the same security; one is not more secure than the other.
The trust models of your deployment determine how you authenticate to Active Directory. Both key trust and certificate trust use the same hardware-backed, two-factor credential. The difference between the two trust types is the issuance of end-entity certificates: Convenience PINprovides a simpler way to sign in to Windows than passwords, but it still uses a password for authentication. When the correct convenience PIN is provided to Windows, the password information is loaded from its cache and authenticates the user. Organizations using convenience PINs should move toWindows Hello for Business. New Windows deployments should deploy Windows Hello for Business and not convenience PINs. No. While it's possible to set a convenience PIN on Microsoft Entra joined and Microsoft Entra hybrid joined devices, convenience PIN isn't supported for Microsoft Entra user accounts (including synchronized identities). Convenience PIN is only supported for on-premises Active Directory users and local account users. Windows Hello for Business is the modern, two-factor authentication for Windows. Customers using virtual smart cards are strongly encouraged to move to Windows Hello for Business. For a list of required URLs, seeMicrosoft 365 Common and Office Online. If your environment uses Microsoft Intune, seeNetwork endpoints for Microsoft Intune. Yes, you can use an external Windows Hello compatible camera if a device has an internal Windows Hello camera. When both cameras are present, the external camera is used for face authentication. For more information, seeIT tools to support Windows 10, version 21H1. If ESS is enabled, seeWindows Hello Enhanced Sign-in Security. Some laptops and tablets with keyboards that close may not use an external Windows Hello compatible camera or other Windows Hello compatible accessory when the computer is docked with the lid closed. The issue has been addressed in Windows 11, version 22H2. Windows Hello for Business credentials need access to device state, which is not available in private browser mode or incognito mode. Hence it can't be used in private browser or Incognito mode. You can usemultifactor unlockto require users to provide an extra factor to unlock their device. Authentication remains two-factor, but another factor is required before Windows allows the user to reach the desktop. To learn more, seeMultifactor Unlock. Windows Hello for Businesscloud Kerberos trustis atrust modelthat enables Windows Hello for Business deployment using the infrastructure introduced for supportingsecurity key sign-in on Microsoft Entra hybrid joined devices and on-premises resource access on Microsoft Entra joined devices. Cloud Kerberos trust is the preferred deployment model if you do not need to support certificate authentication scenarios. For more information, seecloud Kerberos trust deployment. This feature doesn't work in a pure on-premises AD domain services environment. Windows Hello for Business cloud Kerberos trust functions correctly when the client authenticates directly to a writable domain controller or to a Read-Only Domain Controller (RODC) that doesn't cache the user's credentials, in accordance with the Password Replication Policy. If the client attempts to authenticate to an RODC that can cache the user's credentials, cloud Kerberos trust authentication might fail. To mitigate this, deploy KDC certificates to all RODCs to support Windows Hello for Business key trust authentication, which is also required for those RODCs to support LDAP over SSL. This configuration ensures that authentication can seamlessly failover to Windows Hello for Business key trust authentication, thereby guaranteeing successful user authentication. Windows Hello for Business cloud Kerberos trust requires line of sight to a domain controller when: Windows Hello for Business cloud Kerberos trust can't be used as a supplied credential with RDP/VDI. Similar to key trust, cloud Kerberos trust can be used for RDP if acertificate is enrolled into Windows Hello for Businessfor this purpose. As an alternative, consider usingRemote Credential Guardwhich doesn't require to deploy certificates. No, only the number necessary to handle the load from all cloud Kerberos trust devices. In a hybrid deployment, a user's public key must sync from Microsoft Entra ID to Active Directory before it can be used to authenticate against a domain controller. This sync is handled by Microsoft Entra Connect and will occur during a normal sync cycle. Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) doesn't support using key-based authentication as supplied credentials. However, you can deploy certificates in the key trust model to enable RDP. For more information, seeDeploying certificates to key trust users to enable RDP. As an alternative, consider usingRemote Credential Guardwhich doesn't require to deploy certificates.

How can I publish SharePoint over Microsoft Entra application proxy?,Refer toEnable remote access to SharePoint with Microsoft Entra application proxy.,"Microsoft Entra ID is a cloud-based identity and access management solution. It's a directory and identity management service that operates in the cloud and offers authentication and authorization services to various Microsoft services, such as Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and Microsoft Azure. For more information, seeWhat is Microsoft Entra ID? To access the Microsoft Entra admin center or the Azure portal, each user needs permissions with a valid subscription. If you don't have a paid Microsoft 365 or Microsoft Entra subscription, you need to activate a freeMicrosoft Entra Accountor establish a paid subscription. All Azure subscriptions, whether paid or free, have a trust relationship with a Microsoft Entra tenant. All subscriptions rely on the Microsoft Entra tenant (directory) to authenticate and authorize security principals and devices. For more information, seeHow Azure subscriptions are associated with Microsoft Entra ID. Microsoft Entra ID provides you with common identity and access capabilities to all web services. Whether you're using Microsoft services, such as Microsoft 365, Power Platform, Dynamics 365, or other Microsoft products, you're already using Microsoft Entra ID to help turn on sign-on and access management for all cloud services. All users who are set up to use Microsoft services are defined as user accounts in one or more Microsoft Entra instances, providing these accounts access to Microsoft Entra ID. For more information, seeMicrosoft Entra ID Plans & Pricing Microsoft Entra paid services, such as Enterprise Mobility + Security (Microsoft Enterprise Mobility + Security) complement other Microsoft services like Microsoft 365, with comprehensive enterprise-scale development, management, and security solutions. For more information, see TheMicrosoft Cloud. By default, the person who signs up for a Microsoft Entra or Azure subscription is assigned the Owner role for Azure resources. An Owner can use either a Microsoft account or a work or school account from the directory that the Microsoft Entra or Azure subscription is associated with. This role is also authorized to manage services in the Azure portal. If others need to sign in and access services by using the same subscription, you can assign them the appropriatebuilt-in role. For more information, seeAssign Azure roles using the Azure portal. By default, the user who creates a Microsoft Entra tenant is automatically assigned theGlobal Administratorrole. This user has access to all Microsoft Entra directory features. Microsoft Entra ID has a different set of administrator roles to manage the directory and identity-related features. These administrators have access to various features in the Azure portal. The administrator's role determines what they can do, like create or edit users, assign administrative roles to others, reset user passwords, manage user licenses, or manage domains. For more information, seeAssign a user to administrator roles in Microsoft Entra IDandAssigning administrator roles in Microsoft Entra ID. No.  This isn't currently available. To optimize connectivity between your network and the Microsoft Entra admin center and its services, you might want to add specific Microsoft Entra admin center URLs to your allowlist. Doing so can improve performance and connectivity between your local- or wide area network. Network administrators often deploy proxy servers, firewalls, or other devices, which can help secure and give control over how users access the internet. Rules designed to protect users can sometimes block or slow down legitimate business-related internet traffic. This traffic includes communications between you and Microsoft Entra admin center over the following URLs: For more information, seeUsing Microsoft Entra application proxy to publish on-premises apps for remote users. Additional URLs that you should include are listed in the articleAllow the Azure portal URLs on your firewall or proxy server. You can usually leave an organization on your own without having to contact an administrator. However, in some cases this option isn't available and you need to contact your tenant admin, who can delete your account in the external organization. For more information, seeLeave an organization as an external user. You can connect your on-premises directory to Microsoft Entra ID by using Microsoft Entra Connect. For more information, seeIntegrating your on-premises identities with Microsoft Entra ID. You only need to set up single sign-on (SSO) between your on-premises directory and Microsoft Entra ID. As long as you access your cloud applications through Microsoft Entra ID, the service automatically drives your users to correctly authenticate with their on-premises credentials. Implementing SSO from on-premises can be easily achieved with federation solutions such as Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), or by configuring password hash sync. You can easily deploy both options by using the Microsoft Entra Connect configuration wizard. For more information, seeIntegrating your on-premises identities with Microsoft Entra ID. Yes, Microsoft Entra ID provides you with theMicrosoft Entra ID Access Panelfor user self-service and application access. If you're a Microsoft 365 customer, you can find many of the same capabilities in theOffice 365 portal. For more information, seeIntroduction to the Access Panel. Yes. The Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 edition provides you with Microsoft Entra Connect Health. Microsoft Entra Connect Health helps you monitor and gain insight into your on-premises identity infrastructure and the synchronization services. For more information, seeMonitor your on-premises identity infrastructure and synchronization services in the cloud. (For example, is it possible to use Microsoft Entra self-service password reset (SSPR) with password write-back and not store passwords in the cloud?) This example scenario doesn't require the on-premises password to be tracked in Microsoft Entra. This is because you don't need to synchronize your Active Directory passwords to Microsoft Entra ID to enable write-back. In a federated environment, Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) relies on the on-premises directory to authenticate the user. Password write-back operates in real time. For more information, seeGetting started with password management. Yes, if you have password write-back enabled, the password operations performed by an admin are written back to your on-premises environment. For more answers to password-related questions, seePassword management frequently asked questions. There are a couple of options. You can use the self-service password reset (SSPR) if it's available. Whether SSPR works depends on how it's configured.  For more information about resetting Microsoft Entra passwords, seeHow does the password reset portal work. For Microsoft 365 users, your admin can reset the password by using the steps outlined inReset user passwords. For Microsoft Entra accounts, admins can reset passwords by using one of the following: Microsoft Entra ID uses a more sophisticated strategy to lock accounts. This is based on the IP of the request and the passwords entered. The duration of the lockout also increases based on the likelihood that it's an attack. Rejected passwords return the message 'This password has been used too many times'. This refers to passwords that are globally common, such as any variants of ""Password"" and ""123456"". We do have a gateway that filters requests and provides some protection from botnets, and is applied for all B2C tenants. Microsoft Entra ID has more than 2,600 pre-integrated applications from Microsoft, application service providers, and partners. All pre-integrated applications support single sign-on (SSO). SSO lets you use your organizational credentials to access your apps. Some of the applications also support automated provisioning and de-provisioning. For a complete list of the pre-integrated applications, see theAzure Marketplace. With Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2, you can add and configure any application that you want. Depending on your application's capabilities and your preferences, you can configure SSO and automated provisioning. For more information, seeSingle sign-on SAML protocolandDevelop and plan provisioning for a SCIM endpoint. Microsoft Entra ID provides several ways for users to view and access their applications, such as: For more information, seeEnd user experiences for applications. Microsoft Entra ID supports many standardized protocols for authentication and authorization, such as SAML 2.0, OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, and WS-Federation. Microsoft Entra ID also supports password vaulting and automated sign-in capabilities for apps that only support forms-based authentication. For more information, seeIdentity fundamentalsandSingle sign-on for applications in Microsoft Entra ID. Microsoft Entra application proxyprovides you with easy and secure access to on-premises web applications that you choose. You can access these applications in the same way that you access your software as a service (SaaS) apps in Microsoft Entra ID. There's no need for a VPN or to change your network infrastructure. For more information, seeHow to provide secure remote access to on-premises applications. WithMicrosoft Entra Conditional Access, you can assign a unique access policy for each application. In your policy, you can require multifactor authentication always, or when users aren't connected to the local network. For more information, seeSecuring access to Microsoft 365 and other apps connected to Microsoft Entra ID. Use Microsoft Entra ID to automate the creation, maintenance, and removal of user identities in many popular cloud SaaS apps. For more information, seeWhat is app provisioning in Microsoft Entra ID?. No. Microsoft Entra ID doesn't support the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) protocol or Secure LDAP directly. However, it's possible to enable Microsoft Entra Domain Services instance on your Microsoft Entra tenant with properly configured network security groups through Azure Networking to achieve LDAP connectivity.

Can I use the SharePoint mobile app (iOS/ Android) to access a published SharePoint Server?,TheSharePoint mobile appdoesn't support Microsoft Entra preauthentication currently.,"This article is meant to promote a common understanding of the Windows development experience and product direction. Today's Windows app development landscape offers a variety of frameworks and technologies to choose from. This FAQ provides guidance on how to decide which framework to use for your Windows app development projects. It covers the following topics: For a great review of today's options for Windows developers, watch the most recentWindows Dev Chatepisode,Choosing your ideal dev platform, where they discuss WinUI, .NET MAUI, React Native, Blazor, and Progressive Web Apps (PWAs). You can also refer to theoverview of app development optionsfor Windows developers. In the age of cloud services, client app development remains a critical component of modern digital transformation. For developers, building client applications is essential not just for reach but for delivering responsive, meaningful interactions on user devices. Here's why client apps still matter: The Windows App SDK is a Windows application development platform that allows you to create beautiful, modern, backwards-compatible (down to Windows 10 1809) desktop apps. WinUI 3 is the UI framework that ships with Windows App SDK. Both are software development kits (SDKs) that let you build Windows apps. TheWindows App SDKis a new development platform that lets you build modern desktop apps that can be installed across Windows versions (down to Windows 10 1809). When you use Windows App SDK to build an app, you'll have access to the latest Windows development platform features. The Windows App SDK includes WinUI 3. TheWindows SDKis a development platform that lets you build UWP apps and Win32/desktop apps. It's designed around Windows APIs that are coupled to particular versions of the OS. The Windows App SDK doesn't replace the Windows SDK. Instead, the Windows App SDK is a complement to the Windows SDK. It provides a convenient, OS-decoupled abstraction around the rich catalogue of Windows OS APIs that you can already access using the Windows SDK. When you build apps with Windows App SDK, you might end up using some Windows SDK APIs depending on the functionality that you need. Over time, more Windows SDK functionality will be lifted into the Windows App SDK. Here are some reasons to choose a native Windows framework for your Windows-only app: If you're building a new Windows-only app, we recommend using WinUI. WinUI is the latest native UI framework for Windows app development and is designed to work across a wide range of Windows devices. WinUI provides a modern and flexible UI framework that enables you to create visually appealing and interactive Windows apps. WinUI is part of the Windows App SDK and is designed to work best with the latest versions of Windows. Note thatWinUI(a UI framework) ships withWindows App SDK(a Windows platform development framework). Generally speaking, you can't use WinUI unless you're ready to migrate your UI framework entirely. We're working on a feature calledXAML islandsthat lets you host WinUI content in other UI frameworks (WPF, Win32). You should be able to use elements of the Windows App SDK in any desktop app, depending on how your existing app was built. UWP apps are not supported by Windows App SDK. This means thatWPF/MFC/WinFormsapps can use Windows App SDK APIs that are not related to WinUI. Examples of such APIs include App Lifecycle, Windowing, and Toast Notifications. SeeUse the Windows App SDK in an existing projectfor more information. We strongly recommend using Visual Studio 2022 versions 17.10 and above to develop WinUI apps. Using the latest version of Visual Studio will give you access to rich development features like Hot Reload. The latest Visual Studio installers include aWindows application developmentworkload, making it easy to get started with WinUI development. You may be able to use other IDEs and development workflows, butVisual Studiois currently the only officially supported IDE for WinUI. Note thatMSBuildis required to compile projects that use XAML or WinUI. Yes - ""WinUI appâ€ is the term that we recommend you use. WinUI 3 apps are generally referred to as ""WinUI apps"", as WinUI 2 is not a type of app but a set of components that can be used in UWP apps. No. Windows App SDK can't be used in UWP apps, and WinUI 2 can't be mixed with WinUI 3. SeeMigrate from UWP to the Windows App SDK. Migrating UI components is generally straightforward (for C# andC++/WinRT). Otherwise, the cost of migrating from UWP to WinUI will depend primarily on these factors: For more info about UWP migration, seeMigrate from UWP to the Windows App SDK. Yes, upgraded apps can be published without having to update your application's identity. Users who have the old version will get updated to the new version. This guidance applies only to desktop apps. Xbox, HoloLens, and Surface Hub apps can't migrate to WinUI. SeeDeployment overview. SeeMigrate from UWP to the Windows App SDK. No. UI controls can be created in code. But there are many benefits to representing your WinUI user interface in the form of declarative XAML markup, such as improved developer experience. If you're migrating from UWP to WinUI, you'll probably be able to reuse a lot of your XAML markup and UI-related code (but you'll have to update some of the syntax).
If you're migrating from WPF to WinUI, you'll be able to reuse a lot of the concepts, but the control set and APIs will be different. Not yet. We recognize that this is a gap in the WinUI developer experience. Tools likeXAML Hot Reloadcan help in many scenarios.Work has startedon a Visual Studio UI designer for WinUI in Windows App SDK 1.7, but there isn't a timeline for the release of this feature yet. Yes. WinUI 3 ships as a part of the Windows App SDK. No. WinUI 2 is part of the UWP platform. Not quite. Although WinUI 3 started from the WinUI 2 codebase, they are distinct technologies. Both WinUI 2 and WinUI 3 are XAML-based UI frameworks that work across .NET and C++. Note that WinUI 2 and WinUI 3 are not compatible with each other. No. WinUI 3 ships as part of the Windows App SDK. Yes. All technologies in the Windows App SDK work in unpackaged apps, including WinUI 3. XAML Islands allow you to host modern WinUI controls alongside existing Win32 UI from other frameworks, such as WinForms and WPF.
Today, XAML Islands are supported withmostsystem XAML and WinUI 2 controls. SeeHost WinRT XAML controls in desktop apps (XAML Islands)for more information. XAML Islands support for WinUI 3 controls is available starting inWindows App SDK 1.4. Yes, your app's UI will inherit the latest Fluent UI design principles on all supported versions of Windows 11 and Windows 10 down to version 1809 in both packaged and unpackaged scenarios. Yes. SeeApply Mica or Acrylic materials in desktop apps for Windows 11. SeeSample and resources. Some notable repositories: If you have already invested heavily in WPF, you can continue to use WPF for your existing apps. WPF is a mature and stable framework that is widely used by developers to build Windows desktop apps. Consider leveraging the.NET Upgrade Assistantto migrate your .NET Framework WPF apps to the latest .NET platform. The .NET Upgrade Assistant is a tool that helps you migrate your .NET Framework apps to the latest supported versions of .NET. The .NET Upgrade Assistant analyzes your existing codebase and provides guidance on how to update your code. When developing a WPF application with .NET 9 or later, you can ensure your app matches the sleek, modern look of Windows 11. The new Fluent theme for WPF introduces a contemporary Windows 11 aesthetic to WPF applications, complete with integrated Light/Dark mode and system accent color support. This update not only modernizes the appearance of your app but also enhances user engagement by providing a polished and cohesive user experience. If your team is comfortable building WinForms apps and WindForms meets your needs, you can continue to use WinForms for your existing apps. WinForms is a mature and stable framework that is widely used by developers to build Windows desktop apps. The WinForms team is investing across features and has an active community of contributors. Some current areas of investment include: If you're targeting users across multiple OS platforms, building cross-platform apps with .NET MAUI or React Native can provide several benefits: When you build a.NET MAUI app for Windows, your output is a WinUI app. While developing, .NET MAUI provides a single .NET experience across all platforms, including Windows, but under the hood, it generates platform-specific code. This ensures that your .NET MAUI app runs well on each platform and provides a native user experience. .NET MAUI provides a single .NET experience across all platforms, including Windows, iOS, Android, and macOS. .NET MAUI abstracts over 60 platform-specific APIs into a single, cross-platform API that you can use in your .NET MAUI app. These APIs cover access to storage, networking, device-specific sensors, and more. If needed, you can also access additional platform-specific APIs using dependency injection to abstract the code for each platform. Not at this time. Although .NET MAUI apps use WinUI when running on Windows, we recommend starting with .NET MAUI or React Native for Desktop if you anticipate the need to target multiple platforms. If your team has strong web development skills, you may want to consider using React Native for Desktop. React Native for Desktop encompasses the React Native forWindowsandmacOSframeworks. The motto of React Native is ""Learn once, write anywhere,"" which means that you can use your existing web development skills to build native Windows apps using React Native.React Native for Desktopis an open-source project that enables you to build native Windows and macOS apps using React Native. React Native for Desktop provides a set of APIs that allow you to access desktop OS-specific features and capabilities in your React Native apps. Your team can leverage their JavaScript, TypeScript, and React skills to build the UI layer, which is rendered directly to native primitives. This provides native app performance and access to the capabilities of the native platform. Read more about getting started with React Native development for Windows in theReact Native for Desktop documentation. React Native apps can be deployed to all devices supported by Windows 10 and higher including PCs, tablets, 2-in-1s, Xbox, and Mixed reality devices. If your app needs to support Xbox, HoloLens, or IoT, we recommend using UWP. Windows App SDK doesn't support these platforms. For game development, we recommend usingMicrosoft Game Development Kit. If you're targeting both Windows and Surface hub, we recommend using UWP. Hybrid apps blend the best of web and native app development. The core of the app is built using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and then wrapped in a native container that allows the app to leverage certain native platform features and hardware. They can also be distributed through app stores. The main advantage of hybrid apps is that they allow you to build a single app that can run on multiple native platforms and on the web, reducing development time and costs. Some examples of hybrid app development platforms answer: SeeWeb development on WindowsandOverview of Progressive Web Apps. With .NET MAUI, Blazor apps can also run natively on Windows, iOS, Android, and macOS. This means you can create hybrid client apps that combine Blazor and .NET MAUI components together into a single, native client app. This provides full access to the same native platform capabilities available to any other .NET MAUI apps. To read more about how Blazor can hosted within a .NET MAUI app, seeASP.NET Core Blazor Hybrid. No, the web components of a .NET MAUI hybrid app do not need to be created with Blazor. Starting with .NET 9, .NET MAUI provides a HybridWebView control that allows you to host other JavaScript UIs in your native app. This means you can take your Angular, React, Vue or other HTML & JavaScript web app and host it within your .NET MAUI app. The hybrid control provides interop between the C# and JavaScript layers so you can call JavaScript functions from C# and vice versa. Yes, WPF and WinForms apps can also host Blazor hybrid components. This allows you to add modern web UI components to your existing WPF and WinForms apps. Note, that this is not possible with WPF or WinForms apps built on .NET Framework. You can mix and match native and hybrid components in your app. For example, you can build the core of your app using .NET MAUI components and then add hybrid components to provide additional functionality. This allows you to leverage the best of both worlds: the performance and capabilities of native components and the flexibility and cost savings of hybrid components. Web apps have the broadest reach of any client app platform. If you want to create beautiful .NET web apps on Windows, you have several options: Note that the hosting model for Blazor can be configured at the component level now. So, you can have a Blazor WebAssembly component hosted in a Blazor Server app. Read more about ASP.NET Core development options in theASP.NET Core documentation. Windows is an open platform that supports many technologies. Here are some criteria that can help you decide which platform to use: When it comes to business apps, most teams want to choose based on existing skills and what the team is comfortable using. Some things to consider when choosing a development approach for your web app include: Many customers are building with WinUI today, including Adobe and Apple: Microsoft has also created several apps with WinUI, including the Windows 11 File Explorer and Photos apps. Many customers are using .NET MAUI to build their cross-platform apps today, including Microsoft. For example, theMicrosoft Azure mobile appwas built using .NET MAUI. Find out who else is building apps with .NET MAUI on the.NET customers showcasesite. Most of Microsoft Visual Studio's user interface is built with WPF. TheVisual StudioIDE is a great example of a complex, high-performance WPF app. GE Digital'sFlightPulseairline system puts sensor data and analytics into the hands of pilots to improve safety and efficiency. The backend configuration of everything the pilots see is all done with Blazor. You can read moreBlazor customer storieson the .NET site. Yes. If yourMSIXpackage is signed, the signing certificate must be valid and trusted on the target device. Yes - XAML Islands lets you do this.Learn more about XAML Islands. For definitions of apps that are packaged, unpackaged, and packaged with external location, seeDeployment overview. That topic also explains the advantages and disadvantages of each option. A WinUI app can be delivered through the Store, an .appinstaller file, or in your existing MSI or setup.exe package. The Store and the AppInstaller support automatic updates for end-users who have automatic updating enabled, but your MSI/setup.exe app needs to have its own updater. Generally speaking, no. WinUI and Windows App SDK requireMSBuild, which is whyVisual Studiois a prerequisite to developing with WinUI and Windows App SDK. While it's technically possible to build Windows App SDK apps that don't use WinUI using other toolchains, this isn't supported. SeeMake apps great for Windows. Users who have Windows 10, version 1809 and beyond will be able to install your WinUI apps without updating their OS. Yes. No. UWP and WinUI 2 are still supported and will receive bug, reliability, and security fixes. However, most new features and capabilities will only be added to WinUI 3. Note UWP support for .NET 9 is available in preview. This preview support provides a path for UWP apps to modernize using the latest version of .NET. There are two main goals of the .NET 9 UWP support. First, it provides a better migration path for UWP developers who want to migrate to WinUI 3. Second, it enables developers to remove dependencies on .NET Native, so they can benefit from the latest .NET and C# features, no matter what their app model is. For more information, see theModernize your UWP app with preview UWP support for .NET 9 and Native AOTblog post. UWP developers should feel no pressure to migrate their apps to the WinUI 3, if they are happy with UWP and its feature set. The best choice for some apps may be to never migrate.
For apps that want to benefit from the latest Windows platform and .NET investments from Microsoft, these apps should consider moving to the Windows App SDK.
SeeMigrate from UWP to the Windows App SDK). We recommend continuing to use UWP if you're building for Xbox, Surface Hub, or HoloLens. No. WPF is still supported, recommended, and receives feature updates as well. See theWPF roadmap on GitHub. No. WinForms is still supported and receives feature updates. See theWindows Forms Roadmap on GitHub. No.WinRTrefers to an application binary interface (ABI) that lets you interop between multiple languages. WinRT is the evolution of COM. Windows App SDK provides most of its functionality through WinRT APIs. SeeStable channel release notesandPreview channel release notes.

Can I use Microsoft Entra application proxy as AD FS proxy (like Web application proxy)?,"No, Microsoft Entra application proxy is designed to work with Microsoft Entra ID and doesnâ€™t fulfill the requirements to act as an AD FS proxy.","Microsoft Entra ID is a cloud-based identity and access management solution. It's a directory and identity management service that operates in the cloud and offers authentication and authorization services to various Microsoft services, such as Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and Microsoft Azure. For more information, seeWhat is Microsoft Entra ID? To access the Microsoft Entra admin center or the Azure portal, each user needs permissions with a valid subscription. If you don't have a paid Microsoft 365 or Microsoft Entra subscription, you need to activate a freeMicrosoft Entra Accountor establish a paid subscription. All Azure subscriptions, whether paid or free, have a trust relationship with a Microsoft Entra tenant. All subscriptions rely on the Microsoft Entra tenant (directory) to authenticate and authorize security principals and devices. For more information, seeHow Azure subscriptions are associated with Microsoft Entra ID. Microsoft Entra ID provides you with common identity and access capabilities to all web services. Whether you're using Microsoft services, such as Microsoft 365, Power Platform, Dynamics 365, or other Microsoft products, you're already using Microsoft Entra ID to help turn on sign-on and access management for all cloud services. All users who are set up to use Microsoft services are defined as user accounts in one or more Microsoft Entra instances, providing these accounts access to Microsoft Entra ID. For more information, seeMicrosoft Entra ID Plans & Pricing Microsoft Entra paid services, such as Enterprise Mobility + Security (Microsoft Enterprise Mobility + Security) complement other Microsoft services like Microsoft 365, with comprehensive enterprise-scale development, management, and security solutions. For more information, see TheMicrosoft Cloud. By default, the person who signs up for a Microsoft Entra or Azure subscription is assigned the Owner role for Azure resources. An Owner can use either a Microsoft account or a work or school account from the directory that the Microsoft Entra or Azure subscription is associated with. This role is also authorized to manage services in the Azure portal. If others need to sign in and access services by using the same subscription, you can assign them the appropriatebuilt-in role. For more information, seeAssign Azure roles using the Azure portal. By default, the user who creates a Microsoft Entra tenant is automatically assigned theGlobal Administratorrole. This user has access to all Microsoft Entra directory features. Microsoft Entra ID has a different set of administrator roles to manage the directory and identity-related features. These administrators have access to various features in the Azure portal. The administrator's role determines what they can do, like create or edit users, assign administrative roles to others, reset user passwords, manage user licenses, or manage domains. For more information, seeAssign a user to administrator roles in Microsoft Entra IDandAssigning administrator roles in Microsoft Entra ID. No.  This isn't currently available. To optimize connectivity between your network and the Microsoft Entra admin center and its services, you might want to add specific Microsoft Entra admin center URLs to your allowlist. Doing so can improve performance and connectivity between your local- or wide area network. Network administrators often deploy proxy servers, firewalls, or other devices, which can help secure and give control over how users access the internet. Rules designed to protect users can sometimes block or slow down legitimate business-related internet traffic. This traffic includes communications between you and Microsoft Entra admin center over the following URLs: For more information, seeUsing Microsoft Entra application proxy to publish on-premises apps for remote users. Additional URLs that you should include are listed in the articleAllow the Azure portal URLs on your firewall or proxy server. You can usually leave an organization on your own without having to contact an administrator. However, in some cases this option isn't available and you need to contact your tenant admin, who can delete your account in the external organization. For more information, seeLeave an organization as an external user. You can connect your on-premises directory to Microsoft Entra ID by using Microsoft Entra Connect. For more information, seeIntegrating your on-premises identities with Microsoft Entra ID. You only need to set up single sign-on (SSO) between your on-premises directory and Microsoft Entra ID. As long as you access your cloud applications through Microsoft Entra ID, the service automatically drives your users to correctly authenticate with their on-premises credentials. Implementing SSO from on-premises can be easily achieved with federation solutions such as Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), or by configuring password hash sync. You can easily deploy both options by using the Microsoft Entra Connect configuration wizard. For more information, seeIntegrating your on-premises identities with Microsoft Entra ID.

Microsoft Entra ID also supports password vaulting and automated sign-in capabilities for apps that only support forms-based authentication. For more information, seeIdentity fundamentalsandSingle sign-on for applications in Microsoft Entra ID. Microsoft Entra application proxyprovides you with easy and secure access to on-premises web applications that you choose. You can access these applications in the same way that you access your software as a service (SaaS) apps in Microsoft Entra ID. There's no need for a VPN or to change your network infrastructure. For more information, seeHow to provide secure remote access to on-premises applications. WithMicrosoft Entra Conditional Access, you can assign a unique access policy for each application. In your policy, you can require multifactor authentication always, or when users aren't connected to the local network. For more information, seeSecuring access to Microsoft 365 and other apps connected to Microsoft Entra ID. Use Microsoft Entra ID to automate the creation, maintenance, and removal of user identities in many popular cloud SaaS apps. For more information, seeWhat is app provisioning in Microsoft Entra ID?. No. Microsoft Entra ID doesn't support the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) protocol or Secure LDAP directly. However, it's possible to enable Microsoft Entra Domain Services instance on your Microsoft Entra tenant with properly configured network security groups through Azure Networking to achieve LDAP connectivity.

Does using Link translation affect performance?,"Yes. Link translation affects performance. The application proxy service scans the application for hardcoded links and replaces them with their respective, published external URLs before presenting them to the user. For best performance, we recommend using identical internal and external URLs by configuringcustom domains. If using custom domains isn't possible, you can improve link translation performance by using the My Apps Secure Sign in Extension or Microsoft Edge Browser on mobile.

There is a separateFAQ wikithat Partner can share with their Customers post-production. - Integration Phase - Data Privacy - Customer Setup - Product Functionality: One-Click Export - Product Functionality: Misc - Certification Please referenceRSC developer documentation Reach out to LinkedIn Business Development to fill out the Onboarding Request Form and follow steps in theRSC developer documentation. New Talent Solutions integrations like Recruiter System Connect are built on the Middleware Platform, which means you should manage job applications via the /atsApplications and  /atsCandidates endpoint instead of /simpleJobApplications. If youâ€™ve previously integrated with LinkedIn Referrals, youâ€™ll need to switch to using the Middleware Platform for submitting job applications. No. The minimum product and technical requirements for RSC are indicated in this document and partners may not elect to enable a subset. We require all historical candidate, applications, and jobs records to ensure LinkedIn Recruiter is as valuable as possible for your customers [i.e. the â€œRediscovered Candidatesâ€ Spotlight, â€˜In-ATS Indicatorâ€™] Many customers will not need to do so if their privacy policies allows them to share candidate data to their third party partners. However, customers will need to consult their own legal teams regarding this prior to activating RSC. Some partners include a disclaimer in the onboarding widget that requires the customer to authorize the sharing of ATS data with LinkedIn. Customers will be able to turn on all their middleware integrations via a widget in the ATS and in their Recruiter dashboard. Seetechnical docs Customers must email the Partner and LinkedIn support notifying us they would like to deactivate RSC. Customer can contact LinkedIn support at ltsatsintegrations@linkedin.com Rcorp (Recruiter Corporate), RPS (Recruiter Professional Services), and Recruiter SMB The ATS partner can confirm the duplication was handled in the ATS when LI passes back the PersonURN (Member ID) to the ATS Partner LinkedIn members that don't have their privacy settings set to share their profile with third parties will not have One-Click Export functionality enabled. Customer can create a standard ""dummy req"" field in the drop down that Recruiter will be able to export the candidate to if they do not want to associate the candidate with a Job Req. ATS can then conduct any matching required on their end. However, customers will need to consult their legal team to determine if they can export data unassociated with a requisition. Yes it will show all open jobs that the user has permissions to see based on Security Groups. If a Partner has not enabled Security Groups, all open jobs will be seen by all users. Customers can search for jobs based on type head Call volume for One-Click Export is 300 calls per Recruiter seat per month. LinkedIn reserves the right to change rate limits including to prevent abuse and protect privacy and security. ATS will validate this push event against the signature in the request, outlined in ourdocumentation. This is an expected behavior, whencompanyJobCodeexist, it takes precedence overexternalJobPostingId LI will post jobs based on the language that the customer posts in. If the job requires multiple languages, the customer should have separate listings for each language. The preferred integration is to send in real-time Jobs will default to 180 days if there is no expiration date passed in. For jobs with multiple locations, the current solution is to post one requisition per location. Or, send only the primary location if that designation exists.
For jobs with no location (e.g. virtual jobs), you may either: Not send these jobs, or Default to a specific location (for example, headquarter). Jobs will not be posted without a location No, the way the middleware platform is architected, it needs to be through the Simple Job Posting API. Yes, LinkedIn integrations are set up at the contract level, so customers can have separate integrations for any of their contracts. Recruiter users can switch between contracts, and each contract can be associated with one or more integrations.
Partners must be able to support multiple contracts for the same customer. There is an â€œSend InMailâ€ button in the profile widget that allows sending InMails. It sends a notification to the ATS user in LinkedIn Recruiter when there are profile updates for the relevant candidate. If a candidate deletes their LinkedIn account, they can reactivate it within 21 days. After 21 days, we purge the deleted accounts and populate that information within theClosed Candidates Endpoint. Our ATS partners must query this endpoint periodically (at least once in 30 days) and purge the accounts (that appear within this endpoint) from their records. When an API Job is designated asBasic, either by creating a new Basic API Job or by inline downgrading aPremiumAPI Job, it will be visible in the RSC 1CE (one click export).
Inline upgrading aBasicAPI Job to aPremiumJob does not change its visibility in the RSC 1CE; the job remains visible until it is closed.
Similarly, inline downgrading aPremiumAPI Job to aBasicJob will make the job appear in the RSC 1CE. No updates to an API Job, except for theCLOSEaction, are sent to the RSC.
We will implement a change, once ready, where public and private jobs will be synchronized separately. Until your integration aligns with this update, the above recommendation applies to your ATS. Yes, it's an all-or-nothing integration (with the exception of the feature that enables the sending of Interview Notes and Feedback to LinkedIn Recruiter, which is optional) ; however partners can test and certify each module along the way prior to launch. The requirements are laid out in thedeveloperandrequired fieldsdocumentation. First name and last name are used as part of our matching algorithm, though the fields are optional. The preference would be to split firstName and lastName if you have it The throttling is based on the number of API calls being made. We don't have any maximum limits of how much data can be synced by customers. The Sync API will consider any data after the initial push as an update.  As long as you are sending the correct fields and values against it, there should be no problem. This varies across our ATS partners, however we generally see this reflected within a few minutes. Ideally this should be as real-time as possible. Yes, the button should show up if there was a network error. Once the request is sent, the button changes to Notify Partner, after this you should be able to call /atsIntegrationsAPI. People are matched on the basis of email first and then phone number, subject to the relevant memberâ€™s privacy settings. If the matching made is incorrect or cannot be found, LinkedIn allows the Customer to manually match in the Profile Widget. Refer to thisAPI. This updates the 'manualMatchedMember' attribute for synced candidates. It is advised that if the value for the manualMatchedMember field is present then ATS should always use that instead of the values present in the 'matchedMembers' attribute. The jobs are sent in a sequence and also returned back in a sequence. So you would be keeping track of the sequence and able to match it accordingly. No. The minimum character length is to ensure this is a genuine job and not spam. We accept only quality jobs so that is why we have the restriction. If the description is within 10K characters, this should be fine. Within the widget there is a callback function parameter which on link / unlink allows your system to add or update the appropriate person URN to update and store. The person URN connects the candidate to the job post and all other information related to the candidate including notes, job application status, etc. Usein.parse()to reload the widget on a single page application. The Linkedin LTS Partner Operations (PO) team proactively renews contracts. This is a monthly activity and we renew your contract once its near expiry. This gives a seamless LinkedIn RSC experience without the need to raise a ticket for contract renewal. It is recommended to test the InMail functionality for RSC Integrations by sending InMails to your first degree connections. One can send unlimited inMails because there is no restriction to it. To be able to test this feature, the users should be connected to the developers of our team. Through ACL, we control the visibility of any jobs to only user(s). ACLs consist of two parts -atsEntityAclsfor groups andatsEntityAclAssigneesfor members who can view the jobs.

Certificates Monitoring and logging Network configuration Permissions Scaling Generic We recommend that customers install the full certificate chain (leaf cert, intermediate certs, and root cert) instead of just the leaf certificate. When you install just the leaf certificate, you rely on Windows to build the certificate chain by walking the Certificate Trust List (CTL). If intermittent network or Domain Name System (DNS) issues occur in Azure or Windows Update when Windows is trying to validate the certificate, the certificate may be considered invalid. When you install the full certificate chain, this problem can be avoided. The blog atHow to install a chained SSL certificateshows how to do install the full certificate chain. These certificates are automatically created whenever an extension is added to the Cloud Service. Most commonly, this extension is the WAD extension or the RDP extension, but it could be others, such as the Antimalware or Log Collector extension. These certificates are only used for encrypting and decrypting the private configuration for the extension. The expiration date is never checked, so it doesnâ€™t matter if the certificate is expired.â€¯ Youâ€¯can ignore these certificates. Ifâ€¯you wantâ€¯to clean up the certificates, you can try deleting them all. Azure throws an error if you try to delete a certificate that is in use. See the following guidance document: Obtaining a certificate for use with Microsoft Azure Web Sites (WAWS) The CSR is just a text file. It doesn't have to be created from the machine intended to use the certificate.â€¯Although this document is written for an App Service, the CSR creation is generic and applies also for Cloud Services. You can use following PowerShell commands to renew your Management Certificates: TheGet-AzurePublishSettingsFilecreates a new management certificate inSubscription>Management Certificatesin the Azure portal. The name of the new certificate looks like ""YourSubscriptionNam]-[CurrentDate]-credentials"". You can automate this task by using a startup script (batch/cmd/PowerShell) and register that startup script in the service definition file. Add both the startup script and certificate(.p7b file) in the project folder of the same directory of the startup script. This certificate is used to encrypt machine keys on Azure Web Roles. To learn more, check outthis advisory. For more information, see the following articles: Ability to generate a new certificate for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is coming soon. Alternatively, you can run this script: Ability to choose blob or local for your csdef and cscfg upload location is coming soon. UsingNew-AzureDeployment, you can set each location value. Ability to monitor metrics at the instance level. More monitoring capabilities are available inHow to Monitor Cloud Services. Youâ€¯exhausted the local storage quota for writing to the log directory.â€¯To correct this issue, you can do one of three things: For more information, see the following documents: You can enable Microsoft Azure Diagnostics (WAD) logging through following options: In order to get the current WAD settings of your Cloud Service, you can useGet-AzureServiceDiagnosticsExtensionsPowerShell cmd or you can view it through portal from â€œCloud Services --> Extensionsâ€ blade. You can specify the timeout in your service definition (csdef) file like this: SeeNew: Configurable Idle Timeout for Azure Load Balancerfor more information. To set up a static IP address, you need to create a reserved IP. This reserved IP can be associated to a new Cloud Service or to an existing deployment. See the following documents for details: Azure has IPS/IDS in datacenter physical servers to defend against threats. In addition, customers can deploy non-Microsoft security solutions, such as web application firewalls, network firewalls, antimalware, intrusion detection, prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and more. For more information, seeProtect your data and assets and comply with global security standards. Microsoft continuously monitors servers, networks, and applications to detect threats. Azure's multipronged threat-management approach uses intrusion detection, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack prevention, penetration testing, behavioral analytics, anomaly detection, and machine learning to constantly strengthen its defense and reduce risks. Microsoft Antimalware for Azure protects Azure Cloud Services and virtual machines. You can deploy non-Microsoft security solutions in addition, such as web application fire walls, network firewalls, antimalware, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and more. Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 come with support for HTTP/2 on both client and server side. If your client (browser) is connecting to the IIS server over Transport Layer Security (TLS) that negotiates HTTP/2 via TLS extensions, then you don't need to make any change on the server-side. You don't need to make changes because the h2-14 header specifying use of HTTP/2 is sent by default over TLS. If on the other hand your client is sending an Upgrade header to upgrade to HTTP/2, then you need to make the following change on the server side to ensure that the Upgrade works and you end up with an HTTP/2 connection. For more information, see: These steps could be automated via a startup task, so that whenever a new PaaS instance gets created, it can make the previous changes in the system registry. For more information, seeHow to configure and run startup tasks for a Cloud Service. When you finish, you can verify whether the HTTP/2 is enabled or not by using one of the following methods: For more information, seeHTTP/2 on IIS. Cloud Services doesn't support the Azure role-based access control model, as it's not an Azure Resource Manager based service. SeeUnderstand the different roles in Azure. Microsoft follows a strict process that doesn't allow internal engineers to remote desktop into your Cloud Service without written permission (email or other written communication) from the owner or their designee. This error may occur if you use the RDP file from a machine that is joined to Microsoft Entra ID. To resolve this issue, follow these steps: Your Azure Subscription has a limit on the number of cores you can use. Scaling doesn't work if you used all the cores available. For example, if you have a limit of 100 cores, this means you could have 100 A1 sized virtual machine instances for your Cloud Service, or 50 A2 sized virtual machine instances. Autoscale based on Memory metrics for a Cloud Services isn't currently supported. To work around this problem, you can use Application Insights. Auto-Scale supports Application Insights as a Metrics Source and can scale the role instance count based on guest metric like ""Memory.""  You have to configure Application Insights in your Cloud Service project package file (*.cspkg) and enable Azure Diagnostics extension on the service to implement this feat. For more information on how to utilize a custom metric via Application Insights to configure Auto-Scale on  Cloud Services, seeGet started with auto scale by custom metric in Azure For more information on how to integrate Azure Diagnostics with Application Insights for Cloud Services, seeSend Cloud Service, Virtual Machine, or Service Fabric diagnostic data to Application Insights For more information about to enable Application Insights for Cloud Services, seeApplication Insights for Azure Cloud Services For more information about how to enable Azure Diagnostics Logging for Cloud Services, seeSet up diagnostics for Azure Cloud Services and virtual machines To prevent clients from sniffing the MIME types, add a setting in yourweb.configfile. You can also add this as a setting in IIS. Use the following command with thecommon startup tasksarticle. Use the IIS startup script from thecommon startup tasksarticle. SeeService-specific limits. This behavior is expected, and it shouldn't cause any issue to your application. Journaling is turned on for the %approot% drive in Azure PaaS VMs, which essentially consumes double the amount of space that files normally take up. However, there are several things to be aware of that turn this event into a nonissue. The %approot% drive size is calculated as <size of .cspkg + max journal size + a margin of free space>, or 1.5 GB, whichever is larger. The size of your VM has no bearing on this calculation. (The VM size only affects the size of the temporary C: drive.)â€¯ It's unsupported to write to the %approot% drive. If you're writing to the Azure VM, you must do so in a temporary LocalStorage resource (or other option, such as Blob storage, Azure Files, etc.). So the amount of free space on the %approot% folder isn't meaningful. If you aren't sure if your application is writing to the %approot% drive, you can always let your service run for a few days and then compare the ""before"" and ""after"" sizes.â€¯ Azure doesn't write anything to the %approot% drive. Once the virtual hard disk (VHD) is created from your.cspkgand mounted into the Azure VM, the only thing that might write to this drive is your application.â€¯ The journal settings are nonconfigurable, so you can't turn it off. You can enable Antimalware extension using PowerShell script in the Startup Task. To implement it, follow the steps in these articles: For more information about Antimalware deployment scenarios and how to enable it from the portal, seeAntimalware Deployment Scenarios. You can enable SNI in Cloud Services by using one of the following methods: Method 1: Use PowerShell The SNI binding can be configured using the following PowerShell cmdletNew-WebBindingin a startup task for a Cloud Service role instance: As describedhere, the $sslFlags could be one of the following values: Method 2: Use code The SNI binding could also be configured via code in the role startup as described on thisblog post: Using any of the preceding approaches, the respective certificates (*.pfx) for the specific hostnames have to be first installed on the role instances using a startup task or via code in order for the SNI binding to be effective.

"Can you delegate ""logging"" to remote administrators?",No. It is in the site section and only machine administrators can modify this section. You can only delegate whether to log or not.,"For more granular administrative control in Microsoft Entra ID, you can assign users to a Microsoft Entra role with a scope that is limited to one or more administrative units. For sample PowerShell scripts for common tasks, seeWork with administrative units. You must be assigned at least thePrivileged Role Administratorrole to create an administrative unit in Microsoft Entra ID. Check to ensure that the user who's trying to create the administrative unit is assigned thePrivileged Role Administratorrole. When you add a group to an administrative unit, that doesn't result in all the group's members being added to it. Users must be directly assigned to the administrative unit. Sometimes, the addition or removal of one or more members of an administrative unit might take a few minutes to be reflected on theAdministrative unitspane. Alternatively, you can go directly to the associated resource's properties and see whether the action has been completed. For more information about members in administrative units, seeList users, groups, or devices in an administrative unit. As an administrator of an administrative unit, you can reset passwords only for users who are assigned to your administrative unit. Make sure that the user whose password reset is failing belongs to the administrative unit to which you've been assigned. If the user belongs to the same administrative unit but you still can't reset the user's password, check the roles that are assigned to the user. To prevent an elevation of privilege, an administrative unit-scoped administrator can't reset the password of a user who's assigned to a role with an organization-wide scope. Security groups have an existing purpose and authorization model. AUser Administrator, for example, can manage membership of all security groups in the Microsoft Entra organization. The role might use groups to manage access to applications such as Salesforce. AUser Administratorshouldn't be able to manage the delegation model itself, which would be the result if security groups were extended to support ""resource grouping"" scenarios. Administrative units, such as organizational units in Windows Server Active Directory, are intended to provide a way to scope administration of a wide range of directory objects. Security groups themselves can be members of resource scopes. Using security groups to define the set of security groups that an administrator can manage could become confusing. Adding a group to an administrative unit brings the group itself into the management scope of the administrative unit, butnotthe members of the group. For more information, seeAdministrative units in Microsoft Entra ID. Yes, a resource can be a member of more than one administrative unit. The resource can be managed by all organization-wide and administrative unit-scoped administrators who have permissions over the resource. No, administrative units aren't available for B2C organizations. No, nested administrative units aren't supported. Yes. You'll find support for administrative units inPowerShell cmdlet documentationandsample scripts. Find support for theadministrativeUnit resource typein Microsoft Graph. The initial update of an administrative unit can take a few minutes depending on your tenant size and the current Microsoft Entra ID load. This usually means there's a problem with the supplied property values. Confirm that the property values you have supplied have a proper value type (Boolean, string, or string collection). For more information, see the allowed values for each operator forusersordevices. This error can also result if a person without a Microsoft Entra ID P1 license attempts to save an update to the administrative unit. To add a single user, add an appropriate expression with theORquery operator to the rule for dynamic membership groups. When an administrative unit has been configured for dynamic membership groups, you must edit the rules for dynamic membership groups to change membership. The total number of dynamic membership groups and dynamic administrative units combined cannot exceed 15,000. Yes. 3,072 characters. No. As an owner of a protected group, you won't be able to manage it just based on ownership. Managing protected resources currently require a role to be assigned at the restricted management administrative unit scope of the protected resource. Currently, securing Microsoft Entra resources in restricted management administrative units is supported. Resources managed outside of Microsoft Entra ID aren't supported. The user, group, or device is a member of restricted management administrative unit. Management rights are limited to administrators scoped to that administrative unit.

What kind of load does a custom logging module put on the server? (Disabling the kernel mode cache).,"It depends entirely on the application and the logging module implementation. If you are maxing CPU while serving static files, logging to SQL will be very heavy. If you're doing 50 requests/second, logging to SQL will most likely be able to keep up. You are losing the benefits of kernel-mode caching however.","Frequently asked questions about Microsoft Connected Cache Yes. Microsoft Connected Cache is a free service. As an ISP, your network can benefit from reduced load on your backbone and improve customer download experience for supported Microsoft static content. It will also help you save on CDN costs. Microsoft Connected Cache complements peering by offloading static content that is served off of multiple CDNs such as Akamai, Lumen, Edgecast. Static content such as OS updates, Apps, Software installs etc. can't be served via 8075. So, even if you're peering with Microsoft, you can benefit from installing Connected Cache. No, a non-disclosure agreement isn't required. Note The Microsoft Connected Cache is deployed and managed using Azure IoT Edge and Ubuntu 22.04 is anAzure IoT Edge Tier 1 operating system. Additionally, the Microsoft Connected Cache module is optimized for Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. The following are recommended hardware configurations: *Requires systems (chipset, CPU, motherboard) with PCIe version 3, or higher. **Drive speeds are important and to achieve higher egress, we recommend SSD NVMe in m.2 PCIe slot (version 4, or higher). We have one customer who is able to achieve mid-30s Gbps egress rate using the following hardware specification: Microsoft Connected Cache is a software-only caching solution and requires you to provide your own server to host the software. We highly recommend using SSDs as Microsoft Connected Cache is a read intensive application. We also recommend using multiple drives to improve performance. You can choose to route your traffic using manual CIDR blocks or BGP. If you have multiple Microsoft Connected Caches, you can allocate subsets of CIDR blocks to each cache node if you wish. However, since Microsoft Connected Cache has automatic load balancing, we recommend adding all of your traffic to all of your cache nodes. You don't need to add any load balancing. Our service takes care of routing traffic if you have multiple cache nodes serving the same CIDR blocks based on the reported health of the cache node. As stated in the recommended hardware table, the recommended configuration achieves near the maximum possible egress of 40 Gbps with a two-port link aggregated NIC and four cache drives. We have a feature coming soon that helps you estimate the number of cache nodes needed. If your ISP spans multiple countries or regions, you can set up separate cache nodes per country or region. You are in control of your hardware and you can pick the location based on your traffic and end customers. You can choose the location where you have your routers or where you have dense traffic or any other parameters. Once a request for said content is made, NGINX looks at the cache control headers from the original acquisition. If that content is expired, NGINX continues to serve the stale content while it's downloading the new content. We cache the content for 30 days. The content will be in the hot cache path (open handles and such) for 24 hrs, but will reside on disk for 30 days. The drive fills up and nginx will start to delete content based on its own algorithm, probably some combination of least recently used. For more information about content cached, seeDelivery Optimization and Microsoft Connected Cache content endpoints - Windows Deployment. Currently, Microsoft Connected Cache doesn't support Xbox or Teams content. However, supporting Xbox content is of high priority, and we expect this feature soon. We'll let you know as soon as it becomes available! No, we don't currently support IPV6. We plan to support it in the future. We have already successfully onboarded ISPs in many countries and regions around the world and have received positive feedback! However, you can always start off with a portion of your CIDR blocks to test out the performance of Connected Cache before expanding to more customers. Microsoft Connected Cache is a cold cache warmed by client requests. The client requests content and that is what fills up the cache. There's no off-peak cache fill necessary. Microsoft Connected Cache will reach out to different CDN providers just like a client device would. The traffic flow from Microsoft Connected Cache will vary depending on how you currently transit to each of these CDN providers. The content can come from third party CDNs or from AFD. Microsoft relies on a dynamic mix of 1st and 3rd party CDN providers to ensure enough capacity, redundancy, and performance for the delivery of Microsoft served content. Though we don't provide lists of the CDN vendors we utilize as they can change without notice, our endpoints are public knowledge. If someone were to perform a series of DNS lookups against our endpoints (tlu.dl.delivery.mp.microsoft.com for example), they would be able to determine which CDN or CDNs were in rotation at a given point in time: $ dig +noall +answer tlu.dl.delivery.mp.microsoft.com | grep -P ""IN\tA"" c-0001.c-msedge.net.    20      IN      A       13.107.4.50 $ whois 13.107.4.50|grep ""Organization:"" Organization:   Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) If a downstream customer deploys a Microsoft Connected Cache node, the cache controller will prefer the downstream ASN when handling that ASN's traffic. First, check that the email under the NOC role is correct in your PeeringDB page. If the email associated with NOC role is correct, search for an email from the sender ""microsoft-noreply@microsoft.com"" with the email subject - ""Here's your Microsoft Connected Cache verification code"" in your Spam folders. Still can't find it? Ensure that your email admin rules allow emails from the sendermicrosoft-noreply@microsoft.com. BGP routing can be set up as an automatic method of routing traffic. To learn more about how BGP is used with Microsoft Connected Cache, seeBGP Routing. Even when the quota of 8k messages is hit, the Connected Cache functionality isn't affected. Your client devices continue to download content as normal. You also won't be charged above the 8k message limit, so you don't need to worry at all about getting a paid plan. Connected Cache will always be a free service. So if functionality isn't impacted, what is? Instead, messages about the configuration or edge deployment would be impacted. This means that if there was a request to update your Connected Cache and the daily quota was reached, your Connected Cache might not update. In that case, you would just need to wait for the next day to update. This is only a limitation of the early preview and isn't an issue during public preview.

Is there logging of delegated administration? Can we do an audit of delegated administrators?,"The only logging currently available is located in  %systemdrive%\inetpub\logs\wmsvc  However, it does not give any useful information about what was actually done or even which object they connected to, since those are part of the headers. We are looking into changing some of the remoting behavior to use QueryString for certain things so that they can query the log. 
 For example, moving the Module Service and the Method we are invoking as part of the query string would automatically place it in the log. That way you can figure out what is being done in their site. Also, the SiteName and the Application Path that you connected to should be there (connected to default web site), and potentially the current configuration path you are connecting to (now editing MyApp under my Default Web Site connection). One thing we should never include in the query string are arguments, since we do not want potentially sensitive information ending up in your log. This will also prevent the ""email link"" phishing attack.","This article for the IT professional lists questions and answers about understanding, deploying, and managing security audit policies. Security auditing is a methodical examination and review of activities that may affect the security of a system. In the Windows operating systems, security auditing is the features and services for an administrator to log and review events for specified security-related activities. Hundreds of events occur as the Windows operating system and the applications that run on it perform their tasks. Monitoring these events can provide valuable information to help administrators troubleshoot and investigate security-related activities. The basic security audit policy settings inSecurity Settings\Local Policies\Audit Policyand the advanced security audit policy settings inSecurity Settings\Advanced Audit Policy Configuration\System Audit Policiesappear to overlap, but they're recorded and applied differently. When you apply basic audit policy settings to the local computer by using the Local Security Policy snap-in (secpol.msc), you're editing the effective audit policy. Changes made to basic audit policy settings will appear exactly as configured in Auditpol.exe. There are several other differences between the security audit policy settings in these two locations. There are nine basic audit policy settings underSecurity Settings\Local Policies\Audit Policyand settings underAdvanced Audit Policy Configuration. The settings available inSecurity Settings\Advanced Audit Policy
Configurationaddress similar issues as the nine basic settings inLocal Policies\Audit Policy, but they allow administrators to be more selective in the number and types of events to audit. For example, the basic audit policy provides a single setting for account sign-in, and the advanced audit policy provides four. Enabling the single basic setting would be the equivalent of setting all four advanced settings. In comparison, setting a single advanced audit policy setting doesn't generate audit events for activities that you aren't interested in tracking. In addition, if you enable success auditing for the basicAudit account logon eventssetting, only success events will be logged for all account sign-in activities. In comparison, depending on the needs of your organization, you can configure success auditing for one advanced account logon setting, failure auditing for a second advanced account logon setting, success and failure auditing for a third advanced account logon setting, or no auditing. The nine basic settings underSecurity Settings\Local Policies\Audit Policyand the advanced audit policy settings are available in all supported versions of Windows. Basic audit policy settings aren't compatible with advanced audit policy settings that are applied by using group policy. When advanced audit policy settings are applied by using group policy, the current computer's audit policy settings are cleared before the resulting advanced audit policy settings are applied. After you apply advanced audit policy settings by using group policy, you can only reliably set system audit policy for the computer by using the advanced audit policy settings. Editing and applying the advanced audit policy settings in Local Security Policy modifies the local group policy object (GPO). If there are policies from other domain GPOs or logon scripts, changes made here may not be exactly reflected in Auditpol.exe. Both types of policies can be edited and applied by using domain GPOs, and these settings will override any conflicting local audit policy settings. Because the basic audit policy is recorded in the effective audit policy, that audit policy must be explicitly removed when a change is desired, or it will remain in the effective audit policy. Policy changes that are applied by using local or domain group policy settings are reflected as soon as the new policy is applied. Important Whether you apply advanced audit policies by using group policy or by using logon scripts, don't use both the basic audit policy settings underLocal Policies\Audit Policyand the advanced settings underSecurity Settings\Advanced Audit Policy Configuration. Using both advanced and basic audit policy settings can cause unexpected results in audit reporting. If you use Advanced Audit Policy Configuration settings or use logon scripts to apply advanced audit policies, be sure to enable theAudit: Force audit policy subcategory settings to override audit policy category settingspolicy setting underLocal Policies\Security Options. This setting prevents conflicts between similar settings by forcing basic security auditing to be ignored. By default, policy options that are set in GPOs and linked to higher levels of Active Directory sites, domains, and OUs are inherited by all OUs at lower levels. However, an inherited policy can be overridden by a GPO that is linked at a lower level. For example, you might use a domain GPO to assign an organization-wide group of audit settings, but want a certain OU to get a defined group of extra settings. To accomplish this customization, you can link a second GPO to that specific lower-level OU. Therefore, a logon audit setting that is applied at the OU level will override a conflicting logon audit setting that is applied at the domain level. The only exception is if you take special steps to apply group policy loopback processing. The rules that govern how group policy settings are applied propagate to the subcategory level of audit policy settings. This coverage means that audit policy settings configured in different GPOs will be merged if no policy settings configured at a lower level exist. The following table illustrates this behavior. All objects in Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), and all securable objects on a local computer or on the network, have security descriptors to help control access to the objects. Security descriptors include information about who owns an object, who can access it and in what way, and what types of access are audited. Security descriptors contain the access control list (ACL) of an object, which includes all of the security permissions that apply to that object. An object's security descriptor can contain two types of ACLs: The access control model that is used in Windows is administered at the object level by setting different levels of access, or permissions, to objects. If permissions are configured for an object, its security descriptor contains a DACL with security identifiers (SIDs) for the users and groups that are allowed or denied access. If auditing is configured for the object, its security descriptor also contains a SACL that controls how the security subsystem audits attempts to access the object. However, auditing isn't configured entirely unless a SACL has been configured for an object and a correspondingObject Accessaudit policy setting has been configured and applied. In security auditing in Windows, the computer, objects on the computer, and related resources are the primary recipients of actions by clients including applications, other computers, and users. In a security breach, malicious users can use alternate credentials to hide their identity, or malicious applications can impersonate legitimate users to perform undesired tasks. Therefore, the most consistent way to apply an audit policy is to focus on the computer and the objects and resources on that computer. Audit policy capabilities can vary between computers running different versions of Windows. The best way to make sure that the audit policy is applied correctly is to base these settings on the computer instead of the user. However, when you want audit settings to apply only to specified groups of users, you can accomplish this customization by configuring SACLs on the relevant objects to enable auditing for a security group that contains only the users you specify. For example, you can configure a SACL for a folder called Payroll Data on Accounting Server 1. This configuration results in an audit of attempts by members of the Payroll Processors OU to delete objects from this folder. TheObject Access\Audit File Systemaudit policy setting applies to Accounting Server 1. Because it requires a corresponding resource SACL, only actions by members of the Payroll Processors OU on the Payroll Data folder generates audit events. No. Basic and advanced audit policy settings are available in all supported versions of Windows. They can be configured and applied by local or domain group policy settings. A success audit event is triggered when a defined action, such as accessing a file share, is completed successfully. A failure audit event is triggered when a defined action, such as a user sign-in, isn't completed successfully. The appearance of failure audit events in the event log doesn't necessarily mean that something is wrong with your system. For example, if you configure Audit Logon events, a failure event may mean that a user mistyped the password. System administrators and auditors increasingly want to verify that an auditing policy is applied to all objects on a system. This requirement has been difficult to accomplish because the system access control lists (SACLs) that govern auditing are applied on a per-object basis. Thus, to verify that an audit policy has been applied to all objects, you would have to check every object to be sure that no changes have been madeâ€”even temporarily to a single SACL. Security auditing allows administrators to define global object access auditing policies for the entire file system or for the registry on a computer. The specified SACL is then automatically applied to every object of that type. This application of SACL can be useful for verifying that all critical files, folders, and registry settings on a computer are protected. It's also useful to identify when an issue with a system resource occurs. If a file or folder SACL and a global object access auditing policy are configured on a computer, the effective SACL is derived from combining the file or folder SACL and the global object access auditing policy. This behavior also applies to a single registry setting SACL and a global object access auditing policy. This resultant SACL from the combination means that an audit event is generated if an activity matches either the file or folder SACL or the global object access auditing policy. Often it isn't enough to know simply that an object such as a file or folder was accessed. You may also want to know why the user was able to access this resource. You can obtain this forensic data by configuring theAudit Handle Manipulationsetting with theAudit File Systemor with theAudit Registryaudit setting. To track access control changes, you need to enable the following settings, which track changes to DACLs: Applying advanced audit policy settings replaces any comparable basic security audit policy settings. If you later change the advanced audit policy setting toNot configured, you need to complete the following steps to restore the original basic security audit policy settings: Unless you complete all of these steps, the basic audit policy settings won't be restored. Changes to security audit policies are critical security events. You can use theAudit Audit Policy Changesetting to determine if the operating system generates audit events when the following types of activities take place: Finding the right balance between auditing enough network and computer activity and auditing too little network and computer activity can be challenging. You can achieve this balance by identifying the most important resources, critical activities, and users or groups of users. Then design a security audit policy that targets these resources, activities, and users. Useful guidelines and recommendations for developing an effective security auditing strategy can be found inPlanning and deploying advanced security audit policies. The integration of advanced audit policy settings with domain is designed to simplify the management and implementation of security audit policies in an organization's network. As such, tools used to plan and deploy group policy objects for a domain can also be used to plan and deploy security audit policies.
On an individual computer, theAuditpolcommand-line tool can be used to complete many important audit policy-related management tasks. There are also other computer management products, such as the Audit Collection Services in System Center Operations Manager, which can be used to collect and filter event data. For more information, seeHow to install an Audit Collection Services (ACS) collector and database. Users who examine the security event log for the first time can be a bit overwhelmed. The number of audit events that are stored there can quickly number in the thousands. The structured information that's included for each audit event can also be confusing.

Can multiple front ends write to the same log file on a share?,"No, because there is no serialization service that would serialize file access between different writers. The utility Log Parser supports merging log files and potentially supports inserting them into SQL. 
 
 Note 
 Writing to separate logfiles can also help you determine what requests are going to a particular server in the farm. This can be helpful if you are seeing sporadic errors and need to track down what server they occurred on. 
","This article answers common questions about Azure Front Door features and functionality. If you don't see the answer to your question, you can contact us through the following channels (in escalating order): The comments section of this article. Azure Front Door Feedback. Microsoft Support:To create a new support request, in the Azure portal, on theHelptab, select theHelp + supportbutton, and then selectNew support request. Azure Front Door is a cloud-based service that delivers your applications faster and more reliably. It uses layer 7 load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple regions and endpoints. It also offers dynamic site acceleration (DSA) to optimize web performance and near real-time failover to ensure high availability. Azure Front Door is a fully managed service, so you don't have to worry about scaling or maintenance. Azure Front Door is a service that offers many benefits for your web applications, such as dynamic site acceleration (DSA), which improves the performance and user experience of your sites. Azure Front Door also handles TLS/SSL offloading and end to end TLS, which enhances the security and encryption of your web traffic. Additionally, Azure Front Door provides Web Application Firewall, cookie-based session affinity, url path-based routing, free certificates and multiple domain managements, and more. To learn more about the features and capabilities of Azure Front Door, seetier comparison. Azure Front Door and Azure Application Gateway are both load balancers for HTTP/HTTPS traffic, but they have different scopes. Front Door is a global service that can distribute requests across regions, while Application Gateway is a regional service that can balance requests within a region. Azure Front Door works with scale units, clusters or stamp units, while Azure Application Gateway works with VMs, containers or other resources in the same scale unit. Application Gateway behind Front Door is useful in these situations: Chaining two CDNs is generally not a recommended approach, it would work but comes with the following cons To use Azure Front Door, you must have a public VIP or a DNS name that is publicly accessible. Azure Front Door uses the public IP to route the traffic to your origin. A common scenario is to deploy an Azure Load Balancer behind Front Door. You can also use Private Link with Azure Front Door Premium to connect to an internal load balancer. For more information, seeenable Private Link with internal load balancer. Azure Front Door supports HTTP, HTTPS and HTTP/2. Azure Front Door supports HTTP/2 protocol for client connections. However, the backend pool communication uses HTTP/1.1 protocol. HTTP/2 support is on by default. You can use different types of origins for Azure Front Door, such as: The origin must have a public IP or a DNS hostname that can be resolved publicly. You can mix and match backends from different zones, regions, or even outside of Azure, as long as they're publicly accessible. Azure Front Door isn't limited to any Azure region, but operates globally. The only location you have to choose when you create a Front Door is the location of the resource group, which determines where the resource group's metadata get stored. The Front Door profile is a global resource and its configuration is distributed to all edge locations worldwide. For the complete list of points of presence (POPs) that provide global load balancing and content delivery for Azure Front Door, seeAzure Front Door POP locations. This list is updated regularly as new POPs are added or removed. You can also use the Azure Resource Manager API to query the current list of POPs programmatically. Azure Front Door is a service that distributes your application globally across multiple regions. It uses a common infrastructure that gets shared by all its customers, but you can customize your own Front Door profile to configure your application's specific requirements. Other customers' configurations can't affect your Front Door configuration, which is isolated from theirs. You can redirect host, path, and query string components of a URL with Azure Front Door. To learn how to configure URL redirection, refer toURL redirection. Front Door doesn't sort the routes for your web application. Instead, it chooses the route that best fits the request. To find out how Front Door matches requests to routes, seeHow Front Door matches requests to a routing rule. To ensure optimal performance of Front Door's features, you should only allow traffic that comes from Azure Front Door to reach your origin. As a result, unauthorized or malicious requests encounter the security and routing policies of Front Door and are denied access. To learn how to secure your origin, seeSecure traffic to Azure Front Door origins. The IP address of your Front Door's frontend anycast is fixed and might not change as long as you use the Front Door. However, the fixed IP address of your Front Door's frontend anycast isn't a guarantee. Avoid relying on the IP directly. Azure Front Door is a dynamic service that routes traffic to the best available backend. It doesn't offer static or dedicated frontend anycast IPs at this time. Yes. Refer to the MatchedRulesSetName property underAccess Logs. Yes. For more information, seeMicrosoft response to DDoS attacks against HTTP/2. Azure Front Door supports the X-Forwarded-For, X-Forwarded-Host, and X-Forwarded-Proto headers. These headers help Front Door identify the original client IP and protocol. If X-Forwarded-For is already present, Front Door adds the client socket IP to the end of the list. Otherwise, it creates the header with the client socket IP as the value. For X-Forwarded-Host and X-Forwarded-Proto, Front Door replaces the existing values with its own. For more information, seeFront Door supported HTTP headers. The deployment time for new Front Door configurations varies depending on the type of change. Typically, it takes between 3 and 20 minutes for the changes to propagate to all our edge locations worldwide. Note Custom TLS/SSL certificate updates might take longer, from several minutes up to an hour, to be deployed globally. Updates to routes or origin groups/backend pools are seamless and don't cause any downtime (assuming the new configuration is correct). Certificate updates are also done atomically, so there's no risk of outage. No. Currently, Azure Front Door only supports HTTP/1.1 from the edge to the origin. For gRPC to work, HTTP/2 is required. To use Azure Front Door Standard, Premium or (classic) tier, you need a public IP or a DNS name that can be resolved publicly. This requirement of a public IP or a DNS name that can be resolved publicly allows Azure Front Door to route traffic to your backend resources. You can use Azure resources like Application Gateways or Azure Load Balancers to route traffic to resources in a virtual network. If you use Front Door Premium tier, you can use Private Link to connect to origins behind an internal load balancer with a private endpoint. For more information, seeSecure origins with Private Link. An origin group is a collection of origins that can handle similar types of requests. You need a different origin group for each application or workload that is different. In an origin group, you create an origin for every server or service that can serve requests. If your origin has a load balancer, like Azure Application Gateway, or is hosted on a PaaS that has a load balancer, then the origin group only has one origin. Your origin takes care of failover and load balancing between origins that Front Door doesn't see. For example, if you host an application on Azure App Service, how you set up Front Door depends on how many application instances you have: To learn more, seeOrigins and origin groups in Azure Front Door. Azure Front Door is a service that provides fast and reliable web delivery for your applications. It offers features such as caching, load balancing, security, and routing. However, you need to be aware of some timeouts and limits that apply to Azure Front Door. These timeouts and limits include the maximum request size, the maximum response size, the maximum header size, the maximum number of headers, the maximum number of rules, and the maximum number of origin groups. You can find the detailed information about these timeouts and limits in theAzure Front Door documentation. The configuration updates for most rule sets are done in less than 20 minutes. The rule will be applied right after the update is finished. Azure Front Door and Azure CDN are two services that provide fast and reliable web delivery for your applications. However, they aren't compatible with each other, because they share the same network of Azure edge sites to deliver content to your users. This shared network causes conflicts between their routing and caching policies. Therefore, you have to choose either Azure Front Door or Azure CDN for your application, depending on your performance and security requirements. The fact that both profiles would use the same Azure edge sites to handle incoming requests causes this limitation that prevents you from nesting one Azure Front Door profile behind another. This setup would cause routing conflicts and performance issues. Therefore, you should ensure that your Azure Front Door profiles are independent and not chained together, if you need to use multiple profiles for your applications. Azure Front Door uses three service tags to manage the traffic between your clients and your origins: For more information on Azure Front Door service tags scenarios, seeavailable service tags. Azure Front Door has a 5-second timeout for receiving headers from client. The connection is terminated if the client doesn't send headers within 5 seconds to Azure Front Door after establishing TCP/TLS connection. You can't configure this timeout value. Azure Front Door has a 90-second HTTP keep-alive timeout. The connection is terminated if the client doesn't send data for 90 seconds, which is the HTTP keep-alive timeout for Azure Front Door. You can't configure this timeout value. You can't use the same domains for more than one Front Door endpoint, because Front Door needs to distinguish the route (protocol + host + path combination) for each request. If you have duplicate routes across different endpoints, Azure Front Door can't process the requests correctly. At this time, we don't offer the option to move domains from one endpoint to another without any interruption in service. You need to plan for some downtime if you want to migrate your domains to a different endpoint. Azure Front Door Private Link feature is region agnostic and will work even if you choose a region that is different from the region where your origin is located. In such cases, to ensure lower latency, you should always pick an Azure region closest to your origin when choosing to enable Azure Front Door Private Link endpoint. We are in the process of enabling support for more regions. Once a new region is supported, you can follow theseinstructionsto gradually shift traffic to the new region. Azure Front Door is a platform that distributes traffic across the world and can scale up to meet your application's demands. It uses Microsoft's global network edge to deliver global load-balancing capability that lets you switch your entire application or specific microservices to different regions or clouds if there was failure. To avoid errors when delivering large files, make sure your origin server includes theContent-Rangeheader in the response, and that the header value matches the actual size of the response body. You can find more details on how to configure your origin and Front Door for large file delivery inDelivery of large files. Domain fronting is a network technique that enables an attacker to conceal the actual destination of a malicious request by using a different domain name in the TLS handshake and the HTTP host header. Azure Front Door (Standard, Premium and Classic tier) or Azure CDN Standard from Microsoft (classic) resources created after November 8, 2022, have domain fronting blocking enabled. Rather than blocking a request with mismatched SNI and host headers, we permit the discrepancy if the two domains belong to the same subscription and are included in the routes/routing rules. Domain fronting blocking enforcement will start on January 22, 2024, for all existing domains. The enforcement may require up to two weeks to propagate to all regions. When Front Door blocks a request due to a mismatch: For more information about domain fronting, seeSecuring our approach to domain fronting within AzureandProhibiting domain fronting on Azure Front Door and Azure CDN Standard from Microsoft (classic). Front Door uses TLS 1.2 as the minimum version for all profiles created after September 2019. You can choose to use TLS 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 or 1.3 with Azure Front Door. To learn more, read theAzure Front Door end-to-end TLSarticle. Azure Front Door is a service that provides fast and secure web delivery. It allows you to define how your web traffic is routed and optimized across multiple regions and endpoints. Azure Front Door resources, such as Front Door profiles and routing rules, are only charged when they're enabled. However, web application firewall (WAF) policies and rules are charged regardless of their status. Even if you disable a WAF policy or rule, it still incurs costs for you. No. No. AFD does not support dynamic compression for content greater than 8 MB. However, if the content has been already compressed by the origin, Front Door supports serving static compressed content over 8 MB as long as range request is supported and chunked transfer encoding is not enabled. No. For information on logs and other diagnostic capabilities, seeMonitoring metrics and logs for Front Door. You can store diagnostic logs in their own storage account and choose how long to keep them. Alternatively, diagnostic logs can be sent to Event Hubs or Azure Monitor logs. For more information, seeAzure Front Door diagnostics. To access the audit logs of Azure Front Door, you need to visit the portal. Select your Front Door from the menu page and select onActivity Log. The Activity Log provides you with the records of your Azure Front Doorâ€™s operations. You can set up alerts for Azure Front Door based onmetrics or logs. By doing so, you can monitor the performance and health of your front-end hosts. To learn how to create alerts for Azure Front Door Standard and Premium, seeconfigure alerts.

Does the SQL Logging Provider support W3C standards? Can we get logging all centralized into SQL using the W3C extended format?,"ODBC logging is still in the product. It is trivial to write your own SQL logging on top of newer, faster database APIs, however. We would recommend writing an SQL logging module instead of going through the ancient ODBC interfaces.","Applies to:Azure SQL Database The schema info object is only used to split merge scenarios. If an application is inherently single-tenant, then it does not require the Split Merge tool and thus there is no need to populate the schema info object. Please seeAdding a shard to an application using the elastic database client library. Using the elastic database client library does not incur any costs. Costs accrue only for the databases in Azure SQL Database that you use for shards and the Shard Map Manager, as well as the web/worker roles you provision for the Split Merge tool.

Is there any issue with disabling this service?,Turning the service off will disable Windows error reporting and you will not be able to get solutions for problems happening on the machine. There should be no other issues with disabling the service.,"The Microsoft Azure Data Box Disk cloud solution enables you to send terabytes of data to Azure in a quick, inexpensive, and reliable way. This FAQ contains questions and answers that you might have when you use Data Box Disks in the Azure portal. Azure Data Box service is designed for offline data ingestion. This service manages an array of products all tailored for data transport for differing storage capacities. The Azure Data Box Disks allow a quick, inexpensive, and secure transfer of terabytes of data into and out of Azure. Microsoft ships you 1 to 5 disks, with a maximum storage capacity of 35 TB. You can easily configure, connect, and unlock these disks via the Data Box service in Azure portal. Disks are encrypted using Microsoft BitLocker drive encryption, and your encryption keys are managed on the Azure portal. You then copy the data from the customer's servers. In the datacenter, Microsoft migrates your data from drive to cloud using a fast, private network upload link and uploads it to Azure. If you have 40 TB of data (or less) that you want to transfer to Azure, you would benefit from using Data Box Disks. For information on the price of Data Box Disks, go toPricing page. To get Azure Data Box Disks, sign in to the Azure portal and create a Data Box order for disks. Provide your contact information and notification details. Once you place an order, based on the availability, disks are shipped to you within 10 days. For five disks, each with 8-TB capacity (7 TB of usable capacity), the maximum usable capacity is 35 TB. So you can transfer 35 TB of data in one instance. To transfer more data, you need to order more disks. To see where the Data Box Disks are currently available, go to theRegion availability. Data Box Disk is supported for all regions within US, Canada, EU, UK, Australia, Singapore, India, China, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Japan, Korea, and South Africa. Only the Azure public cloud regions are supported. The Azure Government or other sovereign clouds aren't supported. Data Box Disk supports data ingestion only within the same country/region as their destination and won't cross any international borders. The only exception is for orders in the European Union (EU), where Data Box Disks can ship to and from any EU country or region. For example, if you wanted to move data at your location in Canada to an Azure West US storage account, then you could achieve it in the following way: Option 1: Ship asupported diskcontaining data using theAzure Import/Export servicefrom the source location in Canada to the Azure West US datacenter. Option 2: Order Data Box Disk in Canada by choosing a storage account say in Canada Central. SSD disks are shipped from the Azure datacenter in Canada Central to the shipping address (in Canada) provided during order creation. After the data from your on-premises server is copied to the disks, return them to the Azure datacenter in Canada using Microsoft provided return labels. The data present on Data Box Disks then get uploaded to the destination storage account in the Canada Azure region chosen during order creation. You can then use a tool like AzCopy to copy the data to a storage account in West US. This step incursstandard storageandbandwidth chargesthat aren't included in the Data Box Disk billing. No. Data Box Disk doesn't store any customer data outside of the service region. The customer has full ownership of their data and can save the data to a specified location based on the storage account they select during the order creation. In addition to the customer data, there's Data Box Disk data that includes metadata and monitoring logs. In all the regions (except Brazil South, Southeast Asia, and East Asia), Data Box Disk data is stored and replicated in apaired regionvia a Geo-redundant Storage account to protect against data loss. Due todata residency requirementsin Brazil South, Southeast Asia, and East Asia, Data Box Disk data is stored in a Zone-redundant Storage (ZRS) account so that it's contained in a single region. For Southeast Asia, all the Data Box Disk data is stored in Singapore. For Brazil South, the data is stored in Brazil. For East Asia, the data is stored in Hong Kong. If there's a service outage in Brazil South, Southeast Asia, or East Asia, the customers can create new orders from another region. The new orders are served from the region in which they're created and the customers are responsible for the to and fro shipment of the Data Box Disk. No. The Data Box Disk resource doesn't need to be the same as the storage account region where you want to transfer data. You can choose a storage account in any region within the country/region or commerce boundary selected during the order. The Data Box Disk region is only used to deploy the resource during order creation. This is fixed for each country/region or commerce boundary and can't be changed. In extreme circumstances where a region is lost because of a significant disaster, Microsoft might initiate a regional failover. No action on your part is required in this case. Your order is fulfilled through the failover region if it is within the same country/region or commerce boundary. However, some Azure regions don't have a paired region in the same geographic or commerce boundary. If there is a disaster in any of those regions, you will need to create the Data Box order again from a different region that is available, and copy the data to Azure in the new region. For more information, seeCross-region replication in Azure: Business continuity and disaster recovery. If you encounter any issues with Data Box Disks,contact Microsoft Support. To get Azure Data Box Disk, sign in to the Azure portal and create a Data Box Disk order. Provide your contact information and notification details. Once you place an order, based on the availability, Data Box Disk is shipped to you within 10 days. For more information, go toOrder a Data Box. If you can't create a Data Box Disk order, there's a problem with either your subscription type or access. Check your subscription. Data Box Disk is only available for Enterprise Agreement (EA) and Cloud solution provider (CSP) subscription offers. If you don't have either of these subscription types, contact Microsoft Support to upgrade your subscription. If you have a supported offer type for the subscription, check your subscription access level. You need to be a contributor or owner in your subscription to create an order. The following estimated lead times for each phase of order processing will give you a good idea of what to expect. These lead times areestimates. The time for each stage of order processing is affected by load on the datacenter, concurrent orders, and other environmental conditions. Estimated lead times for a Data Box Disk order: No, only import is supported for Data Box Disk. Export functionality is not available. If you want to export data from Azure, you can useAzure Data Box. No. You get 8-TB disks (a maximum of five disks) depending upon your data size and availability of the disks. In the Azure portal, go to your Data Box Disk order, and navigate toDevice details. Copy the passkey. Download and extract the Data Box Disk unlock tool from the Azure portal for your operating system. Run the tool on the computer that has the data you want to copy to the disks. Provide the passkey to unlock your disks. The same passkey unlocks all the disks. For step-by-step instructions, go toUnlock disks. Yes. Both the Linux and Windows clients can be used to connect and copy data on to the Data Box Disks. For more information, go to the list ofSupported operating systemsfor your host computer. You can only cancel the order after the disks are ordered and before the shipment. Once the disks are dispatched, you can no longer cancel the order. However, you can return your disks at a charge. Yes. Multiple Data Box Disks can be connected to the same host computer to transfer data and multiple copy jobs can be run in parallel. You can track the status of the Data Box Disk order in the Azure portal. When you create the order, you are also prompted to provide a notification email. If you have provided one, then you're notified via email on all status changes of the order. More information on how toConfigure notification emails. Microsoft provides a shipping label with the Data Box Disks in the shipping package. Affix the label to the shipping box and drop off the sealed package at your shipping carrier location. If the label is damaged or lost, go toOverview > Download shipping labeland download a new return shipping label. Yes. Microsoft also offers self-managed shipping in US Gov region only. When placing the Data Box Disk order, you can choose self-managed shipping option. To pick up your Data Box Disk order, take the following steps: Once the data copy and validation is complete, take the following steps to return your disk: Once the data validation is complete, unplug the disks. Remove the connecting cables. Wrap all the disks and the connecting cables with a bubble wrap and place them in the shipping box. Charges may apply if the accessories are missing. Go to theOverview bladefor your order in Azure portal. You should see a notification with a code. Use that code and email theAzure Data Box Operations teamand provide them with the code. They would provide you with information on where and when to drop off the disks. Data Box Disks solution can have up to 5 disks with a maximum usable capacity of 35 TB. The disks themselves are 8 TB (usable 7 TB). The maximum sizes are governed by Azure Storage limits. The maximum block blob is roughly 4.768 TiB and the maximum page blob size is 8 TiB. For more information, seeScalability and performance targets for Blob storage. When tested with disks connected via USB 3.0, the disk performance was up to 430 MB/s. The actual numbers vary depending upon the file size used. For smaller files, you may see lower performance. Data Box Disks are encrypted using BitLocker AES-128 bit encryption and the passkey is only available in the Azure portal. Log in to the Azure portal using your account credentials to get the passkey. Supply this passkey when you run the Data Box Disk unlock tool. Use an SMB copy tool such asRobocopy,Diskboss, or even Windows File Explorer drag-and-drop to copy data onto disks. To speed up the copy process: To speed up the copy process: No. Only one storage account, general or classic, is currently supported with Data Box Disks. Both hot and cool blob are supported. Note Classic storage accounts won't be supported startingAugust 1, 2023. The toolset available with the Data Box Disk contains three tools: The toolset is available both for Windows and Linux. You can download the toolset here: Yes, Azure File Sync usage with Data Box Disks is now supported. Once the order status for Data Copy shows as complete, you should be able to access your data right away. When you copy the data underBlockBlobandPageBlobfolders on your disk, a container is created in the Azure storage account for each subfolder under theBlockBlobandPageBlobfolder. If you copied the files under theBlockBlobandPageBlobfolders directly, then the files are in a default container$rootunder the Azure Storage account. When you copy the data into a folder underAzureFilefolder, a fileshare is created. Any uppercase letters in your container names are automatically converted to lowercase. If the names aren't compliant in other ways - for example, they contain special characters or other languages - the upload will fail. For more information, go toAzure naming conventions. After the data copy is complete, you can runDataBoxDiskValidation.cmdprovided in theDataBoxDiskImportfolder to generate checksums for validation. If you have multiple disks, you need to open a command window per disk and run this command. Keep in mind that this operation can take a long time (~hours) depending upon the size of your data. Once the data copy to Azure is complete, the data from the disks is securely erased as per the NIST SP 800-88 Revision 1 guidelines. The Data Box Disks are encrypted with AES-128 Microsoft BitLocker encryption, and a single passkey is required to unlock all the disks and access data. Yes. If you decide to validate your data (we recommend you do!), you need to rerun validation if you added more data to the disks. You can clone your previous order. Cloning creates the same order as before and allow you to edit order details only without the need to type in address, contact, and notification details. Yes. Your data was uploaded to Azure, but if you don't see any managed disks with the specified resource groups, it's likely because the data wasn't valid.

Does IIS 7.0 record compressed or uncompressed (or both) bytes in site log files?,"The *response* size is recorded, so if a 100 KB ASPX response gets compressed to 50 KB, you see 50 KB in the log file. There must be some way of measuring bandwidth savings, because ms.com measured this once.","Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch) This document addresses frequently asked questions about Configuration Manager site sizing guidance and common performance issues. Separate the Configuration Manager inboxes and SQL Server files on at least two different volumes. This separation lets you optimize cluster allocation sizes for the different kinds of I/O they perform. For the volume hosting your sites server inboxes, use NTFS with 4K or 8K allocation units. ReFS writes 64k even for small files. Configuration Manager has many small files, so ReFS can produce unnecessary disk overhead. For disks containing SQL Server database files, use either NTFS or ReFS formatting, with 64K allocation units. Modern arrays of solid-state drives (SSD) and Azure Premium Storage can provide high IOPS on a single volume, with few disks. You typically add more drives to an array for additional storage, not additional throughput. If you're using physical spindle-based disks, you may need more IOPS than you can generate on a single volume. You should allocate 60% of the total recommended IOPS and disk space for the.mdffile, 20% for the.ldffile, and 20% for the log and data temp files. The.ldfand temp files can all reside on a single volume with 40% (20% + 20%) of your allocated IOPS. SQL Server versions earlier than SQL Server 2016 created by default only one temp data file. You should create more, to avoid SQL Server locks and waiting for access to a single file. Community opinions vary on the best number of temp data files to create, from four to eight. Testing reveals little difference between four to eight, so you can create fourequally sizedtemp data files. Your tempdb data files should be up to 20-25% the size of your full database. When configurable, set RAID controller memory to 70% allocation for write operations and 30% for read operations. In general, use a RAID 10 array configuration for the site database. RAID 1 is also acceptable for small-scale sites with low I/O requirements, or if you use fast SSDs. With larger disk arrays, configure spare disks to automatically replace failing disks. Example: Physical machine with physical disks Sizing guidelinesfor a colocated site server and SQL Server with100,000clients are 1200 IOPS for site server inboxes and 5000 IOPS for SQL Server files. Your resulting disk configuration might look like: Hyper-V delivers similar performance to a physical server, if hardware resources (CPU cores and pass-through storage) are 100% dedicated to the virtual machine (VM). Using fixed-size.vhdor.vhdxdisk files causes a minimal 1-5% I/O performance impact. Using dynamically expanding.vhdor.vhdxdisk files causes up to 25% I/O performance impact for the Configuration Manager workload. If you need dynamically expanding disks, compensate by adding an additional 25% IOPS performance to the array. When running your Configuration Manager site server or SQL Server inside a VM, isolate the Hyper-V host OS drives from the VM OS and data drives. For more information about optimizing VMs, seePerformance Tuning Hyper-V Servers. Example: Hyper-V VM-based site server Sizing guidelinesfor a colocated site server and SQL Server with150,000clients are 1800 IOPS for site server inboxes and 7400 IOPS for SQL Server files. Your resulting disk configuration might look like: Start by reading theConfiguration Manager on Azure frequently asked questions. Azure infrastructure as a service (IaaS) VMs that leverage Premium Storage-based disks can have high IOPS. On these VMs, configure additional disks for anticipated disk space needs, rather than for additional IOPS. Azure storage is inherently redundant and doesn't require multiple disks for availability. You can stripe disks in Disk Manager or Storage Spaces to provide additional space and performance. For more information and recommendations on how to maximize Premium Storage performance and run SQL Servers in Azure IaaS VMs, see: Optimize application performance Disks guidance Example: Azure-based site server Sizing guidelinesfor a colocated site server and SQL Server with50,000clients are eight cores, 32 GB, and 1200 IOPS for site server inboxes, and 2800 IOPS for SQL Server files. Your resulting Azure machine might be a DS13v2 (eight cores, 56 GB) with the following disk configuration: Example: Azure-based site server (for instant performance increase) Azure disk throughput is limited by the size of the VM. The configuration in the preceding Azure example may limit future expansion or additional performance. If you add additional disks during initial deployment of your Azure VM, you can upsize your Azure VM for increased processing power in the future, with minimal upfront investment. It's much simpler to plan ahead to increase site performance as requirements change, instead of later needing to do a more complicated migration. Change the disks in the preceding Azure example to see how the IOPS change. DS13v2 If you need more performance in future, you can upsize your VM to a DS14v2, which will double CPU and memory. The additional disk bandwidth allowed by that VM size will also instantly boost the available disk IOPS on your previously configured disks. DS14v2 Both can perform adequately, assuming the single server is appropriately sized, or network connectivity is sufficient between the two servers. Remote SQL Server requires the upfront and operational cost of an additional server, but is typical among the majority of large-scale customers. Benefits of this configuration include: Colocated SQL Server requires a single server, and is typical for most small-scale customers. Benefits of this configuration include: By default, SQL Server uses all available memory on your server, potentially starving the OS and other processes on the machine. To avoid potential performance issues, it's important to allocate memory to SQL Server explicitly. On site servers colocated with SQL Server, make sure the OS has enough RAM for file caching and other operations. Make sure there's enough RAM remaining for SMSExec and other Configuration Manager processes. When running SQL Server on a remote server, you can allocate themajorityof the memory to SQL, but not all. Review thesizing guidelinesfor initial guidance. SQL Server memory allocation should be rounded to whole GB. Also, as RAM increases to large amounts, you can let SQL Server have a higher percentage. For example, when 256 GB or more of RAM is available, you can configure SQL Server for up to 95%, as that still preserves plenty of memory for the OS. Monitoring the page file is a good way to ensure there is enough memory for the OS and any Configuration Manager processes. You may run into memory contention issues if there are more than 16 physical cores and not enough RAM on your SQL Server. The Configuration Manager workload performs better when at least 3-4 GB of RAM per core is available for SQL. When adding cores to your SQL Server, be sure to increase RAM in proportional amounts. In general, availability groups have negligible effect on performance of the system when sufficient networking is available between the replica servers. You can have rapid database log.ldffile growth in a busy availability group environment. However, log file space is automatically released after a successful database backup. Add a SQL Server job for the Configuration Manager database to perform a backup, for example every 24 hours, and an.ldfbackup every six hours. For more information about availability groups and Configuration Manager, including more about SQL Server backup strategies, seePrepare to use a SQL Server Always On availability group. SQL Server compression isn't recommended for the Configuration Manager database. While there are no functional issues with enabling compression on a Configuration Manager database, test results don't show much size savings compared to the potential sizable performance impact to the system. Any secrets in the Configuration Manager database are already stored securely, but adding SQL Server encryption can add yet another layer of security. There are no functional issues with enabling encryption on your database, but there can be up to a 25% performance degradation. Therefore, encrypt with caution, especially in large-scale environments. Also remember to update your backup and recovery plans to ensure you can successfully recover the encrypted data. For supported versions of SQL, seeSupport for SQL Server versions. From a performance standpoint, all supported versions of SQL Server meet required performance criteria. However, SQL Server 2016 or newer tends to outperform SQL Server 2014 in some aspects of the Configuration Manager workload. Also, running SQL Server 2014 at SQL Server 2012 compatibility level (110) improves performance in general. At installation time, Configuration Manager databases running on SQL Server 2014 are set to compatibility level 110. SQL Server 2016 or newer is set to that SQL Server version's default compatibility level, such as 130 for SQL Server 2016. Upgrading SQL Server in place doesn't update compatibility levels until you install the next major Configuration Manager current branch version. If you see unusual timeouts or slowness on certain SQL queries on SQL Server 2016 or later, such as when using RBAC in the Admin Console, try changing the SQL Server compatibility level on the Configuration Manager database to 110. Running at SQL Server compatibility level 110 on SQL Server 2014 and newer versions of SQL Server is fully supported. For more information, seeSQL query times out or console slow on certain Configuration Manager database queries. As of January 2018, you shouldavoidthe following SQL Server versions, because of various known performance-related or other potential issues: Yes, update indexes as often as once a week and statistics as often as once a day to improve SQL Server performance. Third-party scripts and additional information available from the Configuration Manager and SQL Server communities can help optimize these tasks. In large sites, some SQL Server tables, such as CI_CurrentComplianceStatusDetails, HinvChangeLog, might be large, depending on your usage patterns. You may need to reduce or alter your maintenance approach for them one by one. SQL Server Express doesn't have any significant performance implications on secondary sites, and it's adequate for most customers. It's also easy to deploy and manage, and is the recommended configuration for nearly all customers at any size. There's one situation where a full SQL Server installation might be needed. If you have a large number of distribution points and packages or sources in your environment, it's possible to exceed the 10-GB size limit of SQL Server Express. If the number of packages times the number of distribution points is more than 4,000,000, such as 2,000 DPs with 2,000 pieces of content, consider using full SQL Server at your secondary sites. Leaving your setting at 0 (use all available processors) is optimal for overall processing performance in most circumstances. Many Configuration Manager administrators follow the guidance atRecommendations and guidelines for the ""max degree of parallelism"" configuration option in SQL Server. On most modern large hardware, this guidance leads to a suggested maximum setting of eight. However, if you run many smaller queries compared to your number of processors, it may help to set it to a higher number. Limiting yourself to eight isn't necessarily the best setting on larger sites when more cores are available. On SQL Servers with greater than eight cores, start with a setting of 0, and only make changes if you experience performance issues or excessive locking. If you need to change MaxDOP because you are encountering performance issues at 0, start with a new value at least greater than or equal to the minimum recommended number of cores for that site's SQL Server sizing. Going lower than this value nearly always has negative performance implications. For example, a remote SQL Server for a 100,000 client site needs at least 12 cores. If your SQL Server has 16 cores, start testing your MaxDOP setting with a value of 12. Take care when disabling antivirus protection on any system. In high volume and secure environments, we recommend disablingactive monitoringfor optimum performance. For more information about recommended antivirus exclusions, seeRecommended antivirus exclusions for Configuration Manager 2012 and Current Branch Site Servers, Site Systems, and Clients. Changing a few key IIS settings, such as WsusPool Queue Length and WsusPool Private Memory limit, can improve WSUS performance, even on smaller installations. For more information, seeRecommended hardware. Also make sure you have the latest updates installed for the operating system running WSUS: SeeThe complete guide to Microsoft WSUS and Configuration Manager SUP maintenance. Traditional server performance monitoring works effectively for general Configuration Manager. You can also leverage the various System Center Operations Manager management packs for Configuration Manager, SQL Server, and Windows Server to monitor basic health of your servers. You can also directly monitor the Windows Performance Monitor (PerfMon) counters Configuration Manager provides. Monitor the backlogs in the various inboxes for early warning signs of potential site performance issues or backlogs.

"If I am installing Windows 7 on Skylake, which configuration should be chosen? Should the firmware CSM be enabled with UEFI boot (Config #2) or legacy boot MBR (Config #3)? If Legacy boot mode, why?","Specifically, for Windows 7 it is recommended to use Config #2. You will need to enable the CSM and set default to UEFI boot, falling back to legacy boot only if needed. Secure Boot will need to be disabled. 
 Windows 7 is not able to support Config #1. Windows 7 has a dependency on Int10 support for basic display when the high-res graphics driver is not available (for example, Bugcheck, Sleep transitions, etc.), a dependency satisfied by the CSM. You can boot Win7 in UEFI mode if a partial CSM is in place (enabled) providing Int10 support. If firmware defaults to UEFI boot mode leaving Int10 CSM enabled, then Win7 will install successfully in UEFI mode. Microsoft has also backported TPM 2.0 support to Windows 7 for when it is installed in UEFI mode. For more information, see this KB article:  KB2920188 . 
 Microsoft recommends you should use Config #2; Legacy MBR Boot mode should not be used.","This article provides a list of frequently asked questions about the GUID Partition Table disk architecture. Applies to:Windows Server 2012 R2Original KB number:302873 Important This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, seeHow to back up and restore the registry in Windows. The GUID Partition Table disk architecture was introduced as part of the Extensible Firmware Interface initiative. GUID Partition Table is a new disk architecture that expands on the older Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning scheme that has been common to Intel-based computers. A partition is a contiguous space of storage on a physical or logical disk that functions as though it were a physically separate disk. Partitions are visible to the system firmware and the installed operating systems. Access to a partition is controlled by the system firmware and the operating system that is currently active. GUID Partition Table disks can grow to a large size. As of July 2001, the Microsoft implementation supports a hard disk of up to 18 EB (512 KB LBAs). The number of partitions on a GUID Partition Table disk is not constrained by temporary schemes such as container partitions as defined by the MBR Extended Boot Record. The Microsoft implementation of GUID Partition Table is limited to 128 partitions. However, it is important to note that one partition is used for the EFI System Partition, one for the Microsoft Reserved and two more are used if you use dynamic disks. This leaves 124 partitions for data use. The GUID Partition Table disk partition format is well defined and fully self-identifying. Data that is critical to the operating system is located in partitions and not in unpartitioned orhiddensectors. GUID Partition Table does not allow for hidden sectors or partitions. GUID Partition Table disks use primary and backup partition tables for redundancy and CRC32 fields for improved partition data structure integrity. The GUID Partition Table partition format uses version number and size fields for future expansion. Each GUID Partition Table partition has a unique identification GUID and a partition content type, so no coordination is necessary to prevent partition identifier collision. Each GUID Partition Table partition has a 36-character Unicode name, which means that any software can present an easily readable name for the partition without any additional understanding of the partition. MBR disks support only four primary partitions table entries or multiple logical partitions in the extended partition. If more partitions are wanted, a secondary structure, an extended partition, is necessary. Extended partitions are then subdivided into one or more logical disks. Only one extended partition can be present on any given drive, and the maximum number of logical drives is MAXULONG/4. All MBR disk partitions and logical drives must be cylinder-aligned, even on hardware RAID sets that are built from multiple different drives with no clear underlying physical geometry. MBR partitioning rules are complex and poorly specified. For example, does cylinder alignment mean that each partition must be at least one cylinder in length? An MBR partition is identified by a two-byte field, and coordination is necessary to avoid collision. IBM originally provided that coordination, but as of July 2001, there is no single authoritative list of partition identifiers. Another common practice is to use partitioned or ""hidden"" sectors to hold specific information. That practice is undocumented and results in severe system problems that are difficult to debug. Over the years, broken implementations and tools have been released to the public, making support difficult. Chapter 16 of the Extensible Firmware Interface specification defines the GUID Partition Table format. This document is available at the following Intel Web site: The Unified EFI Specification Defines an Interface Between an Operating System and Platform Firmware Third-party information disclaimer The third-party products that this article discusses are manufactured by companies that are independent of Microsoft. Microsoft makes no warranty, implied or otherwise, about the performance or reliability of these products. No. GUID Partition Table disks are self-identifying. All the information that is needed to interpret the partitioning scheme of a GUID Partition Table disk is completely contained in structures in specified locations on the physical media. In theory, a GUID Partition Table disk can be up to 264 sectors in a single logical block in length. Logical blocks are commonly 512 bytes or one sector in size. In practice, Windows XP supports GUID Partition Table disks of up to approximately 18 exabytes in size. In theory, an unlimited number. As the July 2001, the Microsoft implementation is 128 partitions. The number of partitions is limited by the amount of space that is reserved for making partition entries. No. However, all GUID Partition Table disks contain a protective MBR that is used for legacy programs that do not understand the GUID Partition Table disk structure. The Protective MBR, beginning in sector 0, precedes the GUID Partition Table partition table on the disk. The MBR contains one type 0xEE partition that spans the entire length of the disk. This is the same regardless of the number of partitions that are defined in the GUID Partition Table disk entry array. The Protective MBR protects GUID Partition Table disks from previously-released MBR disk tools such as Microsoft MS-DOS FDISK or Microsoft Windows NT Disk Administrator. These tools are not aware of GUID Partition Table and do not know how to properly access a GUID Partition Table disk. Legacy software that does not know about GUID Partition Table interprets only the Protected MBR when it accesses a GUID Partition Table disk. These tools will view a GUID Partition Table disk as having a single encompassing (possibly unrecognized) partition by interpreting the Protected MBR, rather than mistaking the disk for one that is unpartitioned. If this occurred, you must have used an MBR-only-aware disk tool to access the GUID Partition Table disk. The EE partition in the Protective MBR is specified to be the maximum size that is allowable in an MBR. Can the 64-bit version of Windows XP read, write, and boot from GUID Partition Table disks? The 64-bit version of Windows XP can read and write GUID Partition Table disks, but cannot boot from GUID Partition Table disks. Can the 64-bit version of Windows XP read, write, and boot from MBR disks? Yes. Can the 32-bit version of Windows XP read, write, and boot from GUID Partition Table disks? No. The 32-bit version will see only the Protective MBR. The EE partition will not be mounted or otherwise exposed to program software. Can the 32-bit version of Windows XP read, write, and boot from MBR disks? Yes. Can Microsoft Windows 2000, Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, or Microsoft Windows 98/95 read, write, and boot from GUID Partition Table? No. Legacy software will see only the Protective MBR. GUID Partition Table and MBR disks can be mixed only on 64-bit systems, and the following restrictions apply: The Windows XP loader and the boot partition must reside on a GUID Partition Table disk. Other hard disks can be either MBR or GUID Partition Table. Both MBR and GUID Partition Table disks can be present in a single dynamic disk group. Volume sets can span both MBR and GUID Partition Table disks, however, the MBR cylinder alignment restriction might cause some difficulties with mirroring or striping MBR and GUID Partition Table disks. Removable media must be MBR orsuperfloppy. Removable media without either GUID Partition Table or MBR formatting is considered a superfloppy. The entire media is treated as a single partition. The media manufacturer performs any MBR partitioning of removable media; Windows never partitions removable media. If the media does have an MBR, only one partition is supported. There is little user-discernible difference between MBR-partitioned media and superfloppies. Examples of removable media include floppy disks, JAZZ disk cartridges, magneto-optical media, DVD-ROM, and CD-ROM. Hard disk drives on external buses such as SCSI or IEEE 1394 are not considered removable. What is the default behavior of the 64-bit version of Windows XP when partitioning media? Fixed disks are partitioned by using GUID Partition Table partitioning. GUID Partition Table disks can be converted to MBR disks only if all existing partitioning is first deleted, with associated loss of data. What is the default behavior of the 32-bit version of Windows XP when partitioning media? Only MBR disks can be used. MBR disks cannot be converted to GUID Partition Table disks. How can a drive letter in the operating system be mapped to a partition in Extensible Firmware Interface Firmware? There is no inherent mapping between drive letter and partition that can be used to determine one from the other. A basic data partition must be identified by its partition GUID. How can an Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition be created? Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions can be created by using the Extensible Firmware Interface firmware utility Diskpart.efi or the Windows XP command-line utility Diskpart.exe, or they can be created programmatically by using IOCTL_SET_DRIVE_LAYOUT . You should not change any partition header entry directly. Do not use disk tools or utilities to make alterations or changes. Detachable disks are commonly expected to migrate between computers or simply to be unavailable to the operating system at times. Examples of detachable disks are IEEE 1394 disks, which can be easily disconnected by the end user, or Microsoft Cluster Services (MSCS) shared disks, which move between nodes in a cluster. Windows XP supports only MBR partitioning on detachable disks. What is the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition? The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition contains the NTLDR, Boot.ini, and other files that are necessary to boot the computer, such as drivers. The Partition GUID defines the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition: DEFINE_GUID (PARTITION_SYSTEM_GUID, 0xC12A7328L, 0xF81F, 0x11D2, 0xBA, 0x4B, 0x00, 0xA0, 0xC9, 0x3E, 0xC9, 0x3B) Do only GUID Partition Table disks have Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions? No, MBR disks can also have Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions. Extensible Firmware Interface specifies booting from either GUID Partition Table or MBR. The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions on an MBR disk is identified by partition type 0xEF. However, Windows XP does not support booting Extensible Firmware Interface from MBR disks or 0xEF partitions. How big is the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition? The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is determined by using the following algorithm: Max (100MB, min (1 percent of physical disk, 1GB)) In other words, the size of the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition must be the larger of these two numbers, 100 MB or 1 percent of the physical disk size (up to 1 GB). The physical disk size is measured at the time of disk partitioning. The value 1 percent of the physical disk is calculated at the time that the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is created and does not change if the disk is extended later (for example, by using RAID). Can there be two Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions on a single disk? Such a configuration should not be created and will not be supported. What about two Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions on two different disks? Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions can be replicated for high-availability configurations. Replication must be done manually and the contents must be synchronized manually. Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions cannot be mirrored. What does Microsoft place in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition? Microsoft places the loader, and other files that are necessary to boot the operating system in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. Where should the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition be placed on the disk? The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition must be first on the disk. While there is no architectural requirement, there are numerous reasons why it is beneficial to place the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition first. The primary reason for this is that it is impossible to span volumes when the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is logically between the two data partitions you are attempting to span. What should a computer or device manufacturer place in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition? The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition should only include files that are required for booting an operating system, platform tools that run before operating system boot, or files that must be accessed before operating system boot, for example in performing pre-boot system maintenance. Other value-added files or diagnostics that are used while the operating system is running should not be placed in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. It is important to note that the space in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is a limited system resource; its primary purpose is to provide storage for the files that are necessary to boot the operating system. The preferred option is for computer manufacturers to place value-added contents in an OEM-specific partition. Just like MBR OEM partitions, the contents of GUID Partition Table OEM (or other unrecognized) partitions are not exposed (given drive letters or returned in volume lists). Users are warned that deleting the partition can cause the computer to fail to operate. An OEM-specific partition should be placed before the Microsoft Reserved Partition and after any Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition on the disk. Although not architectural, this placement has the same benefits as placing the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition first. For example, it is also impossible to span volumes when an OEM-specific partition is logically between the two data partitions you are attempting to span. Placement in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is an option for programs or files that run in the pre-operating system boot environment. However, the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is architecturally-shared space and represents a limited resource. Consuming space in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition should be considered carefully. Files that are not relevant to the pre-operating system boot environment should not be placed in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. What is a Microsoft Reserved Partition? The Microsoft Reserved Partition reserves space on each disk drive for subsequent use by operating system software. GUID Partition Table disks do not allow hidden sectors. Software components that formerly used hidden sectors now allocate portions of the Microsoft Reserved Partition for component-specific partitions. For example, converting a basic disk to a dynamic disk causes the Microsoft Reserved Partition on that disk to be reduced in size and a newly created partition holds the dynamic disk database. The Microsoft Reserved Partition has the following Partition GUID: DEFINE_GUID (PARTITION_MSFT_RESERVED_GUID, 0xE3C9E316L, 0x0B5C, 0x4DB8, 0x81, 0x7D, 0xF9, 0x2D, 0xF0, 0x02, 0x15, 0xAE What disks require a Microsoft Reserved Partition? Every GUID Partition Table disk must contain a Microsoft Reserved Partition. The Microsoft Reserved Partition must be the first partition after the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition (if any) on the disk. It is particularly important that the Microsoft Reserved Partition be created before other primary data partitions. Who creates the Microsoft Reserved Partition? The Microsoft Reserved Partition must be created when disk-partitioning information is first written to the drive. If the manufacturer partitions the disk, the manufacturer must create the Microsoft Reserved Partition at the same time. If Windows partitions the disk during Setup, it creates the Microsoft Reserved Partition. Why must the Microsoft Reserved Partition be created when the disk is first partitioned? After the disk is partitioned, there will be no free space left to create a Microsoft Reserved Partition. How big is the Microsoft Reserved Partition? When initially created, the size of the Microsoft Reserved Partition depends on the size of the disk drive: Each bootable drive must contain an Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition, a Microsoft Reserved Partition, and at least one basic data partition that contains the operating system. Each data drive must contain at least a Microsoft Reserved Partition and one basic data partition. All basic data partitions on the drive should be contiguous. As previously noted, placing an OEM-specific or other unrecognized partition between data partitions imposes limitations on later volume spanning Basic data partitions correspond to primary MBR partitions 0x6 (FAT), 0x7 (NTFS), or 0xB (FAT32). There is a direct one-to-one correlation between a basic data partition and a drive letter or mount point, other volume device object, or both. Each basic data partition is represented in Windows as a volume device object, and optionally as a mount point or a drive letter. It has the following partition type GUID: DEFINE_GUID (PARTITION_BASIC_DATA_GUID, 0xEBD0A0A2L, 0xB9E5, 0x4433, 0x87, 0xC0, 0x68, 0xB6, 0xB7, 0x26, 0x99, 0xC7) The user won't see these partitions exposed in Windows Explorer, nor is any recognized file system exposed to legacy programs such as Context Indexing. The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition, OEM-specific, and other unrecognized partitions will be visible only in the Disk Management MMC snap-in. Windows XP exposes only basic data partitions. Other partitions with FAT file systems may be mounted, but not exposed (only programmatically). Only basic data partitions are assigned drive letters or mount points. The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition FAT file system is mounted, but not exposed. This allows programs running under Windows to update the contents of the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. The following registry key locates the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/System/Setup/SystemPartition The Microsoft Reserved Partition (and any partitions that are created from the Microsoft Reserved Partition) could have recognizable file systems; none are exposed. Any OEM-specific partitions or partitions that are associated with other operating systems are not recognized by Windows. Unrecognized partitions with recognizable file systems are treated like the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. They will be mounted, but not exposed. Unlike MBR disks, there is no practical difference between OEM-specific partitions and other operating system partitions; all are unrecognized. The user can use disk management tools such as the Disk Management MMC snap-in or Diskpart.exe. The Microsoft Reserved Partition and any partitions that are created from the Microsoft Reserved Partition are only visible from a command prompt. Dynamic disks use two different GUID Partition Table partitions: A data container partition corresponding to the MBR partition 0x42, with the following GUID:DEFINE_GUID (PARTITION_LDM_DATA_GUID, 0xAF9B60A0L, 0x1431, 0x4F62, 0xBC, 0x68, 0x33, 0x11, 0x71, 0x4A, 0x69, 0xAD) A partition to contain the dynamic configuration database, with the following GUID:DEFINE_GUID(PARTITION_LDM_METADATA_GUID, 0x5808C8AAL, 0x7E8F, 0x42E0, 0x85, 0xD2, 0xE1, 0xE9, 0x04, 0x34, 0xCF, 0xB3)
Volumes are created in the data container and are mounted by default. This is the same as the contents of 0x42 MBR partitions. For a drive to be eligible for conversion to dynamic, all basic data partitions on the drive must be contiguous. If other unrecognized partitions separate basic data partitions, the disk cannot be converted. This is one of the reasons that the Microsoft Reserved Partition must be created before any basic data partitions. The first step in conversion is to separate a portion of the Microsoft Reserved Partition to create the configuration database partition. All non-bootable basic partitions are then combined into a single data container partition. Boot partitions are retained as separate data container partitions. This is analogous to conversion of primary partitions. Windows XP differs from Windows 2000 in that basic and extended partitions are preferentially converted to a single 0x42 partition, rather than being retained as multiple distinct 0x42 partitions as on Windows 2000. You can access the GUID Partition Table disk partitions of different types by using the following tools. Diskpart.efi:Firmware: Extensible Firmware Interface System PartitionMicrosoft Reserved Partition Diskpart.exe:Windows XP: Extensible Firmware Interface System PartitionMicrosoft Reserved Partition Diskgmt.msc:Windows XP: Extensible Firmware Interface System PartitionDATA Explorer.exe:Windows XP: DATA You can also develop your own tools (by using the Microsoft Win32 or Microsoft Win64 APIs) to access the GUID Partition Table disk partitions at their primitive levels. GUID Partition Table and MBR disks are managed the same way. Disks can be formatted as GUID Partition Table or MBR by using the Diskpart.exe command-line utility or by using the Disk Management snap-in. Volumes can be created on both GUID Partition Table and MBR disks, and both kinds of disks can be mixed in the same dynamic disk group. There is no FTdisk set support on Windows XP for MBR or GUID Partition Table disks. The only support for logical volumes is through dynamic disks. Yes, but only if the disk contains no partitions or volumes. Any data on the disk will be destroyed. GUID Partition Table disks are only supported on the 64-bit version of Windows XP. NTFS is recommended on all basic data partitions and all dynamic volumes. Windows Setup and the Disk Management snap-in offer only NTFS. However, you can still use FAT16 and FAT32 on these partitions as well. To circumvent this, the partition or volume must be formatted explicitly by using the Format tool. No. The Disk and Partition GUIDs will no longer be unique. This must never happen. You can make a sector-by-sector copy of the contents of Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition or basic data partitions. Yes; however, there are some key caveats. The OEM Preinstallation Kit (OPK) initializes the Disk and Partition GUIDs to zero. On first boot of Windows XP, the operating system generates unique GUIDs. The OPK only supports generation of Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition, Microsoft Reserved Partition, and basic data partitions. If a program has recorded any Disk or Partition GUIDs, the program may not work. Any programs, drivers, utilities, or firmware implementations that are supplied by computer manufacturers or program vendors that rely on GUIDs should be capable of handling GUIDs that change from the OPK initialization values to those that are generated by the operating system. It is a way for OEMs to simplify operating system pre-installation and system recovery. This command can easily be extended to create a default disk configuration for the platform. For example, the computer manufacturer could extend the MAKE command to automatically partition the boot drive with an Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition, Microsoft Reserved Partition, an OEM-specific partition, and one basic data partition. For example, consider a possible disk configuration called BOOT_DISK. In the event of disaster recovery, MAKE BOOT_DISK would allow the customer to completely repartition a boot disk to the original factory defaults. Windows XP will generate new GUIDs for any duplicate Disk GUID, Microsoft Reserved Partition GUID, or Microsoft Reserved Partition basic data GUID upon detection. This is similar to the duplicate MBR signature handling in Windows 2000. Duplicate GUIDs on a dynamic container or database partition cause unpredictable results. This depends on the cluster size that is selected at the time of formatting. NTFS is currently limited to 2^32-1 allocation units. This yields a 256TB volume, using 64k clusters. However, this has only been tested to 16TB, or 17,592,186,040,320 bytes, using 4K cluster size. The following chart shows the NTFS limits based on cluster size: For example, to format a volume that has a cluster size of 8 KB, you would use a command such as the following from a command prompt, where/a: ####specifies the number of bytes per cluster: If you choose a cluster size that is too small for the size of the partition, you receive the following error message when you try to format the partition: The format operation did not complete because the cluster count is higher than expected To determine the cluster size of a volume, run the following command at a command prompt, and then note theBytes Per Clustervalue: Note The <volume> placeholder represents the volume letter. For example, when you run thefsutil fsinfo ntfsinfo c:command, you may receive results that resemble the following output: NTFS Volume Serial Number : 0xf4300f6c300f3560Version : 3.1Number Sectors : 0x000000001d17dbeeTotal Clusters : 0x0000000003a2fb7dFree Clusters : 0x000000000102bfa0Total Reserved : 0x0000000000000800Bytes Per Sector : 512Bytes Per Cluster : 4096Bytes Per FileRecord Segment : 1024Clusters Per FileRecord Segment : 0Mft Valid Data Length : 0x000000000e630000Mft Start Lcn : 0x00000000000c0000Mft2 Start Lcn : 0x0000000001d17dbeMft Zone Start : 0x00000000002185a0Mft Zone End : 0x0000000000218740RM Identifier : 1587CC47-A713-11DB-9287-806E6F6E6963 Note In this example, theBytes Per Clustervalue is 4096. This value represents a 4-kilobyte (KB) cluster size.

"If I installed Windows 7 with CSM enabled, what will the partition table/disk configuration look like?","It depends on the boot devices priority defaults in firmware. If CSM is enabled and loaded into memory, this can sometimes cause install media to default to Legacy MBR boot. 
 If you boot to legacy boot mode and go through installation you will typically have 2 partitions (as listed with diskpart.exe ""list partition""). The first partition being active and listed as âsystem partitionâ, file system type being NTFS with a hidden \boot folder. The second partition is where \Windows is installed on another NTFS partition. 
 If Windows is installing in UEFI mode, installation will create the EFI System Partition (ESP) as file system type Fat32, the Microsoft Reserve Partition (MSR) as RAW, and an OS / data partition using NTFS. If you mount and look at the ESP, you should see a folder \EFI boot folder (folder may be hidden). 
 Since you will need to leave CSM enabled in the system firmware for Windows 7, you may need to specifically select UEFI boot mode when booting to installation media (CD/DVD/USB) in order to install Windows 7 in UEFI boot mode.
Consult with PC manufacture for more information concerning boot options and BIOS configuration.","This article provides a list of frequently asked questions about the GUID Partition Table disk architecture. Applies to:Windows Server 2012 R2Original KB number:302873 Important This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, seeHow to back up and restore the registry in Windows. The GUID Partition Table disk architecture was introduced as part of the Extensible Firmware Interface initiative. GUID Partition Table is a new disk architecture that expands on the older Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning scheme that has been common to Intel-based computers. A partition is a contiguous space of storage on a physical or logical disk that functions as though it were a physically separate disk. Partitions are visible to the system firmware and the installed operating systems. Access to a partition is controlled by the system firmware and the operating system that is currently active. GUID Partition Table disks can grow to a large size. As of July 2001, the Microsoft implementation supports a hard disk of up to 18 EB (512 KB LBAs). The number of partitions on a GUID Partition Table disk is not constrained by temporary schemes such as container partitions as defined by the MBR Extended Boot Record. The Microsoft implementation of GUID Partition Table is limited to 128 partitions. However, it is important to note that one partition is used for the EFI System Partition, one for the Microsoft Reserved and two more are used if you use dynamic disks. This leaves 124 partitions for data use. The GUID Partition Table disk partition format is well defined and fully self-identifying. Data that is critical to the operating system is located in partitions and not in unpartitioned orhiddensectors. GUID Partition Table does not allow for hidden sectors or partitions. GUID Partition Table disks use primary and backup partition tables for redundancy and CRC32 fields for improved partition data structure integrity. The GUID Partition Table partition format uses version number and size fields for future expansion. Each GUID Partition Table partition has a unique identification GUID and a partition content type, so no coordination is necessary to prevent partition identifier collision. Each GUID Partition Table partition has a 36-character Unicode name, which means that any software can present an easily readable name for the partition without any additional understanding of the partition. MBR disks support only four primary partitions table entries or multiple logical partitions in the extended partition. If more partitions are wanted, a secondary structure, an extended partition, is necessary. Extended partitions are then subdivided into one or more logical disks. Only one extended partition can be present on any given drive, and the maximum number of logical drives is MAXULONG/4. All MBR disk partitions and logical drives must be cylinder-aligned, even on hardware RAID sets that are built from multiple different drives with no clear underlying physical geometry. MBR partitioning rules are complex and poorly specified. For example, does cylinder alignment mean that each partition must be at least one cylinder in length? An MBR partition is identified by a two-byte field, and coordination is necessary to avoid collision. IBM originally provided that coordination, but as of July 2001, there is no single authoritative list of partition identifiers. Another common practice is to use partitioned or ""hidden"" sectors to hold specific information. That practice is undocumented and results in severe system problems that are difficult to debug. Over the years, broken implementations and tools have been released to the public, making support difficult. Chapter 16 of the Extensible Firmware Interface specification defines the GUID Partition Table format. This document is available at the following Intel Web site: The Unified EFI Specification Defines an Interface Between an Operating System and Platform Firmware Third-party information disclaimer The third-party products that this article discusses are manufactured by companies that are independent of Microsoft. Microsoft makes no warranty, implied or otherwise, about the performance or reliability of these products. No. GUID Partition Table disks are self-identifying. All the information that is needed to interpret the partitioning scheme of a GUID Partition Table disk is completely contained in structures in specified locations on the physical media. In theory, a GUID Partition Table disk can be up to 264 sectors in a single logical block in length. Logical blocks are commonly 512 bytes or one sector in size. In practice, Windows XP supports GUID Partition Table disks of up to approximately 18 exabytes in size. In theory, an unlimited number. As the July 2001, the Microsoft implementation is 128 partitions. The number of partitions is limited by the amount of space that is reserved for making partition entries. No. However, all GUID Partition Table disks contain a protective MBR that is used for legacy programs that do not understand the GUID Partition Table disk structure. The Protective MBR, beginning in sector 0, precedes the GUID Partition Table partition table on the disk. The MBR contains one type 0xEE partition that spans the entire length of the disk. This is the same regardless of the number of partitions that are defined in the GUID Partition Table disk entry array. The Protective MBR protects GUID Partition Table disks from previously-released MBR disk tools such as Microsoft MS-DOS FDISK or Microsoft Windows NT Disk Administrator. These tools are not aware of GUID Partition Table and do not know how to properly access a GUID Partition Table disk. Legacy software that does not know about GUID Partition Table interprets only the Protected MBR when it accesses a GUID Partition Table disk. These tools will view a GUID Partition Table disk as having a single encompassing (possibly unrecognized) partition by interpreting the Protected MBR, rather than mistaking the disk for one that is unpartitioned. If this occurred, you must have used an MBR-only-aware disk tool to access the GUID Partition Table disk. The EE partition in the Protective MBR is specified to be the maximum size that is allowable in an MBR. Can the 64-bit version of Windows XP read, write, and boot from GUID Partition Table disks? The 64-bit version of Windows XP can read and write GUID Partition Table disks, but cannot boot from GUID Partition Table disks. Can the 64-bit version of Windows XP read, write, and boot from MBR disks? Yes. Can the 32-bit version of Windows XP read, write, and boot from GUID Partition Table disks? No. The 32-bit version will see only the Protective MBR. The EE partition will not be mounted or otherwise exposed to program software. Can the 32-bit version of Windows XP read, write, and boot from MBR disks? Yes. Can Microsoft Windows 2000, Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, or Microsoft Windows 98/95 read, write, and boot from GUID Partition Table? No. Legacy software will see only the Protective MBR. GUID Partition Table and MBR disks can be mixed only on 64-bit systems, and the following restrictions apply: The Windows XP loader and the boot partition must reside on a GUID Partition Table disk. Other hard disks can be either MBR or GUID Partition Table. Both MBR and GUID Partition Table disks can be present in a single dynamic disk group. Volume sets can span both MBR and GUID Partition Table disks, however, the MBR cylinder alignment restriction might cause some difficulties with mirroring or striping MBR and GUID Partition Table disks. Removable media must be MBR orsuperfloppy. Removable media without either GUID Partition Table or MBR formatting is considered a superfloppy. The entire media is treated as a single partition. The media manufacturer performs any MBR partitioning of removable media; Windows never partitions removable media. If the media does have an MBR, only one partition is supported. There is little user-discernible difference between MBR-partitioned media and superfloppies. Examples of removable media include floppy disks, JAZZ disk cartridges, magneto-optical media, DVD-ROM, and CD-ROM. Hard disk drives on external buses such as SCSI or IEEE 1394 are not considered removable. What is the default behavior of the 64-bit version of Windows XP when partitioning media? Fixed disks are partitioned by using GUID Partition Table partitioning. GUID Partition Table disks can be converted to MBR disks only if all existing partitioning is first deleted, with associated loss of data. What is the default behavior of the 32-bit version of Windows XP when partitioning media? Only MBR disks can be used. MBR disks cannot be converted to GUID Partition Table disks. How can a drive letter in the operating system be mapped to a partition in Extensible Firmware Interface Firmware? There is no inherent mapping between drive letter and partition that can be used to determine one from the other. A basic data partition must be identified by its partition GUID. How can an Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition be created? Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions can be created by using the Extensible Firmware Interface firmware utility Diskpart.efi or the Windows XP command-line utility Diskpart.exe, or they can be created programmatically by using IOCTL_SET_DRIVE_LAYOUT . You should not change any partition header entry directly. Do not use disk tools or utilities to make alterations or changes. Detachable disks are commonly expected to migrate between computers or simply to be unavailable to the operating system at times. Examples of detachable disks are IEEE 1394 disks, which can be easily disconnected by the end user, or Microsoft Cluster Services (MSCS) shared disks, which move between nodes in a cluster. Windows XP supports only MBR partitioning on detachable disks. What is the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition? The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition contains the NTLDR, Boot.ini, and other files that are necessary to boot the computer, such as drivers. The Partition GUID defines the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition: DEFINE_GUID (PARTITION_SYSTEM_GUID, 0xC12A7328L, 0xF81F, 0x11D2, 0xBA, 0x4B, 0x00, 0xA0, 0xC9, 0x3E, 0xC9, 0x3B) Do only GUID Partition Table disks have Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions? No, MBR disks can also have Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions. Extensible Firmware Interface specifies booting from either GUID Partition Table or MBR. The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions on an MBR disk is identified by partition type 0xEF. However, Windows XP does not support booting Extensible Firmware Interface from MBR disks or 0xEF partitions. How big is the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition? The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is determined by using the following algorithm: Max (100MB, min (1 percent of physical disk, 1GB)) In other words, the size of the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition must be the larger of these two numbers, 100 MB or 1 percent of the physical disk size (up to 1 GB). The physical disk size is measured at the time of disk partitioning. The value 1 percent of the physical disk is calculated at the time that the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is created and does not change if the disk is extended later (for example, by using RAID). Can there be two Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions on a single disk? Such a configuration should not be created and will not be supported. What about two Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions on two different disks? Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions can be replicated for high-availability configurations. Replication must be done manually and the contents must be synchronized manually. Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions cannot be mirrored. What does Microsoft place in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition? Microsoft places the loader, and other files that are necessary to boot the operating system in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. Where should the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition be placed on the disk? The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition must be first on the disk. While there is no architectural requirement, there are numerous reasons why it is beneficial to place the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition first. The primary reason for this is that it is impossible to span volumes when the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is logically between the two data partitions you are attempting to span. What should a computer or device manufacturer place in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition? The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition should only include files that are required for booting an operating system, platform tools that run before operating system boot, or files that must be accessed before operating system boot, for example in performing pre-boot system maintenance. Other value-added files or diagnostics that are used while the operating system is running should not be placed in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. It is important to note that the space in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is a limited system resource; its primary purpose is to provide storage for the files that are necessary to boot the operating system. The preferred option is for computer manufacturers to place value-added contents in an OEM-specific partition. Just like MBR OEM partitions, the contents of GUID Partition Table OEM (or other unrecognized) partitions are not exposed (given drive letters or returned in volume lists). Users are warned that deleting the partition can cause the computer to fail to operate. An OEM-specific partition should be placed before the Microsoft Reserved Partition and after any Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition on the disk. Although not architectural, this placement has the same benefits as placing the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition first. For example, it is also impossible to span volumes when an OEM-specific partition is logically between the two data partitions you are attempting to span. Placement in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is an option for programs or files that run in the pre-operating system boot environment. However, the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is architecturally-shared space and represents a limited resource. Consuming space in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition should be considered carefully. Files that are not relevant to the pre-operating system boot environment should not be placed in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. What is a Microsoft Reserved Partition? The Microsoft Reserved Partition reserves space on each disk drive for subsequent use by operating system software. GUID Partition Table disks do not allow hidden sectors. Software components that formerly used hidden sectors now allocate portions of the Microsoft Reserved Partition for component-specific partitions. For example, converting a basic disk to a dynamic disk causes the Microsoft Reserved Partition on that disk to be reduced in size and a newly created partition holds the dynamic disk database. The Microsoft Reserved Partition has the following Partition GUID: DEFINE_GUID (PARTITION_MSFT_RESERVED_GUID, 0xE3C9E316L, 0x0B5C, 0x4DB8, 0x81, 0x7D, 0xF9, 0x2D, 0xF0, 0x02, 0x15, 0xAE What disks require a Microsoft Reserved Partition? Every GUID Partition Table disk must contain a Microsoft Reserved Partition. The Microsoft Reserved Partition must be the first partition after the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition (if any) on the disk. It is particularly important that the Microsoft Reserved Partition be created before other primary data partitions. Who creates the Microsoft Reserved Partition? The Microsoft Reserved Partition must be created when disk-partitioning information is first written to the drive. If the manufacturer partitions the disk, the manufacturer must create the Microsoft Reserved Partition at the same time. If Windows partitions the disk during Setup, it creates the Microsoft Reserved Partition. Why must the Microsoft Reserved Partition be created when the disk is first partitioned? After the disk is partitioned, there will be no free space left to create a Microsoft Reserved Partition. How big is the Microsoft Reserved Partition? When initially created, the size of the Microsoft Reserved Partition depends on the size of the disk drive: Each bootable drive must contain an Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition, a Microsoft Reserved Partition, and at least one basic data partition that contains the operating system. Each data drive must contain at least a Microsoft Reserved Partition and one basic data partition. All basic data partitions on the drive should be contiguous. As previously noted, placing an OEM-specific or other unrecognized partition between data partitions imposes limitations on later volume spanning Basic data partitions correspond to primary MBR partitions 0x6 (FAT), 0x7 (NTFS), or 0xB (FAT32). There is a direct one-to-one correlation between a basic data partition and a drive letter or mount point, other volume device object, or both. Each basic data partition is represented in Windows as a volume device object, and optionally as a mount point or a drive letter. It has the following partition type GUID: DEFINE_GUID (PARTITION_BASIC_DATA_GUID, 0xEBD0A0A2L, 0xB9E5, 0x4433, 0x87, 0xC0, 0x68, 0xB6, 0xB7, 0x26, 0x99, 0xC7) The user won't see these partitions exposed in Windows Explorer, nor is any recognized file system exposed to legacy programs such as Context Indexing. The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition, OEM-specific, and other unrecognized partitions will be visible only in the Disk Management MMC snap-in. Windows XP exposes only basic data partitions. Other partitions with FAT file systems may be mounted, but not exposed (only programmatically). Only basic data partitions are assigned drive letters or mount points. The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition FAT file system is mounted, but not exposed. This allows programs running under Windows to update the contents of the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. The following registry key locates the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/System/Setup/SystemPartition The Microsoft Reserved Partition (and any partitions that are created from the Microsoft Reserved Partition) could have recognizable file systems; none are exposed. Any OEM-specific partitions or partitions that are associated with other operating systems are not recognized by Windows. Unrecognized partitions with recognizable file systems are treated like the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. They will be mounted, but not exposed. Unlike MBR disks, there is no practical difference between OEM-specific partitions and other operating system partitions; all are unrecognized. The user can use disk management tools such as the Disk Management MMC snap-in or Diskpart.exe. The Microsoft Reserved Partition and any partitions that are created from the Microsoft Reserved Partition are only visible from a command prompt. Dynamic disks use two different GUID Partition Table partitions: A data container partition corresponding to the MBR partition 0x42, with the following GUID:DEFINE_GUID (PARTITION_LDM_DATA_GUID, 0xAF9B60A0L, 0x1431, 0x4F62, 0xBC, 0x68, 0x33, 0x11, 0x71, 0x4A, 0x69, 0xAD) A partition to contain the dynamic configuration database, with the following GUID:DEFINE_GUID(PARTITION_LDM_METADATA_GUID, 0x5808C8AAL, 0x7E8F, 0x42E0, 0x85, 0xD2, 0xE1, 0xE9, 0x04, 0x34, 0xCF, 0xB3)
Volumes are created in the data container and are mounted by default. This is the same as the contents of 0x42 MBR partitions. For a drive to be eligible for conversion to dynamic, all basic data partitions on the drive must be contiguous. If other unrecognized partitions separate basic data partitions, the disk cannot be converted. This is one of the reasons that the Microsoft Reserved Partition must be created before any basic data partitions. The first step in conversion is to separate a portion of the Microsoft Reserved Partition to create the configuration database partition. All non-bootable basic partitions are then combined into a single data container partition. Boot partitions are retained as separate data container partitions. This is analogous to conversion of primary partitions. Windows XP differs from Windows 2000 in that basic and extended partitions are preferentially converted to a single 0x42 partition, rather than being retained as multiple distinct 0x42 partitions as on Windows 2000. You can access the GUID Partition Table disk partitions of different types by using the following tools. Diskpart.efi:Firmware: Extensible Firmware Interface System PartitionMicrosoft Reserved Partition Diskpart.exe:Windows XP: Extensible Firmware Interface System PartitionMicrosoft Reserved Partition Diskgmt.msc:Windows XP: Extensible Firmware Interface System PartitionDATA Explorer.exe:Windows XP: DATA You can also develop your own tools (by using the Microsoft Win32 or Microsoft Win64 APIs) to access the GUID Partition Table disk partitions at their primitive levels. GUID Partition Table and MBR disks are managed the same way. Disks can be formatted as GUID Partition Table or MBR by using the Diskpart.exe command-line utility or by using the Disk Management snap-in. Volumes can be created on both GUID Partition Table and MBR disks, and both kinds of disks can be mixed in the same dynamic disk group. There is no FTdisk set support on Windows XP for MBR or GUID Partition Table disks. The only support for logical volumes is through dynamic disks. Yes, but only if the disk contains no partitions or volumes. Any data on the disk will be destroyed. GUID Partition Table disks are only supported on the 64-bit version of Windows XP. NTFS is recommended on all basic data partitions and all dynamic volumes. Windows Setup and the Disk Management snap-in offer only NTFS. However, you can still use FAT16 and FAT32 on these partitions as well. To circumvent this, the partition or volume must be formatted explicitly by using the Format tool. No. The Disk and Partition GUIDs will no longer be unique. This must never happen. You can make a sector-by-sector copy of the contents of Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition or basic data partitions. Yes; however, there are some key caveats. The OEM Preinstallation Kit (OPK) initializes the Disk and Partition GUIDs to zero. On first boot of Windows XP, the operating system generates unique GUIDs. The OPK only supports generation of Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition, Microsoft Reserved Partition, and basic data partitions. If a program has recorded any Disk or Partition GUIDs, the program may not work. Any programs, drivers, utilities, or firmware implementations that are supplied by computer manufacturers or program vendors that rely on GUIDs should be capable of handling GUIDs that change from the OPK initialization values to those that are generated by the operating system. It is a way for OEMs to simplify operating system pre-installation and system recovery. This command can easily be extended to create a default disk configuration for the platform. For example, the computer manufacturer could extend the MAKE command to automatically partition the boot drive with an Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition, Microsoft Reserved Partition, an OEM-specific partition, and one basic data partition. For example, consider a possible disk configuration called BOOT_DISK. In the event of disaster recovery, MAKE BOOT_DISK would allow the customer to completely repartition a boot disk to the original factory defaults. Windows XP will generate new GUIDs for any duplicate Disk GUID, Microsoft Reserved Partition GUID, or Microsoft Reserved Partition basic data GUID upon detection. This is similar to the duplicate MBR signature handling in Windows 2000. Duplicate GUIDs on a dynamic container or database partition cause unpredictable results. This depends on the cluster size that is selected at the time of formatting. NTFS is currently limited to 2^32-1 allocation units. This yields a 256TB volume, using 64k clusters. However, this has only been tested to 16TB, or 17,592,186,040,320 bytes, using 4K cluster size. The following chart shows the NTFS limits based on cluster size: For example, to format a volume that has a cluster size of 8 KB, you would use a command such as the following from a command prompt, where/a: ####specifies the number of bytes per cluster: If you choose a cluster size that is too small for the size of the partition, you receive the following error message when you try to format the partition: The format operation did not complete because the cluster count is higher than expected To determine the cluster size of a volume, run the following command at a command prompt, and then note theBytes Per Clustervalue: Note The <volume> placeholder represents the volume letter. For example, when you run thefsutil fsinfo ntfsinfo c:command, you may receive results that resemble the following output: NTFS Volume Serial Number : 0xf4300f6c300f3560Version : 3.1Number Sectors : 0x000000001d17dbeeTotal Clusters : 0x0000000003a2fb7dFree Clusters : 0x000000000102bfa0Total Reserved : 0x0000000000000800Bytes Per Sector : 512Bytes Per Cluster : 4096Bytes Per FileRecord Segment : 1024Clusters Per FileRecord Segment : 0Mft Valid Data Length : 0x000000000e630000Mft Start Lcn : 0x00000000000c0000Mft2 Start Lcn : 0x0000000001d17dbeMft Zone Start : 0x00000000002185a0Mft Zone End : 0x0000000000218740RM Identifier : 1587CC47-A713-11DB-9287-806E6F6E6963 Note In this example, theBytes Per Clustervalue is 4096. This value represents a 4-kilobyte (KB) cluster size.

Applies to:Windows Server 2012 R2Original KB number:302873 Important This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, seeHow to back up and restore the registry in Windows. The GUID Partition Table disk architecture was introduced as part of the Extensible Firmware Interface initiative. GUID Partition Table is a new disk architecture that expands on the older Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning scheme that has been common to Intel-based computers. A partition is a contiguous space of storage on a physical or logical disk that functions as though it were a physically separate disk. Partitions are visible to the system firmware and the installed operating systems. Access to a partition is controlled by the system firmware and the operating system that is currently active. GUID Partition Table disks can grow to a large size. As of July 2001, the Microsoft implementation supports a hard disk of up to 18 EB (512 KB LBAs). The number of partitions on a GUID Partition Table disk is not constrained by temporary schemes such as container partitions as defined by the MBR Extended Boot Record. The Microsoft implementation of GUID Partition Table is limited to 128 partitions. However, it is important to note that one partition is used for the EFI System Partition, one for the Microsoft Reserved and two more are used if you use dynamic disks. This leaves 124 partitions for data use. The GUID Partition Table disk partition format is well defined and fully self-identifying. Data that is critical to the operating system is located in partitions and not in unpartitioned orhiddensectors. GUID Partition Table does not allow for hidden sectors or partitions. GUID Partition Table disks use primary and backup partition tables for redundancy and CRC32 fields for improved partition data structure integrity. The GUID Partition Table partition format uses version number and size fields for future expansion. Each GUID Partition Table partition has a unique identification GUID and a partition content type, so no coordination is necessary to prevent partition identifier collision. Each GUID Partition Table partition has a 36-character Unicode name, which means that any software can present an easily readable name for the partition without any additional understanding of the partition. MBR disks support only four primary partitions table entries or multiple logical partitions in the extended partition. If more partitions are wanted, a secondary structure, an extended partition, is necessary. Extended partitions are then subdivided into one or more logical disks. Only one extended partition can be present on any given drive, and the maximum number of logical drives is MAXULONG/4. All MBR disk partitions and logical drives must be cylinder-aligned, even on hardware RAID sets that are built from multiple different drives with no clear underlying physical geometry. MBR partitioning rules are complex and poorly specified. For example, does cylinder alignment mean that each partition must be at least one cylinder in length? An MBR partition is identified by a two-byte field, and coordination is necessary to avoid collision. IBM originally provided that coordination, but as of July 2001, there is no single authoritative list of partition identifiers. Another common practice is to use partitioned or ""hidden"" sectors to hold specific information. That practice is undocumented and results in severe system problems that are difficult to debug. Over the years, broken implementations and tools have been released to the public, making support difficult. Chapter 16 of the Extensible Firmware Interface specification defines the GUID Partition Table format. This document is available at the following Intel Web site: The Unified EFI Specification Defines an Interface Between an Operating System and Platform Firmware Third-party information disclaimer The third-party products that this article discusses are manufactured by companies that are independent of Microsoft. Microsoft makes no warranty, implied or otherwise, about the performance or reliability of these products. No. GUID Partition Table disks are self-identifying. All the information that is needed to interpret the partitioning scheme of a GUID Partition Table disk is completely contained in structures in specified locations on the physical media. In theory, a GUID Partition Table disk can be up to 264 sectors in a single logical block in length. Logical blocks are commonly 512 bytes or one sector in size. In practice, Windows XP supports GUID Partition Table disks of up to approximately 18 exabytes in size. In theory, an unlimited number. As the July 2001, the Microsoft implementation is 128 partitions. The number of partitions is limited by the amount of space that is reserved for making partition entries. No. However, all GUID Partition Table disks contain a protective MBR that is used for legacy programs that do not understand the GUID Partition Table disk structure. The Protective MBR, beginning in sector 0, precedes the GUID Partition Table partition table on the disk. The MBR contains one type 0xEE partition that spans the entire length of the disk. This is the same regardless of the number of partitions that are defined in the GUID Partition Table disk entry array. The Protective MBR protects GUID Partition Table disks from previously-released MBR disk tools such as Microsoft MS-DOS FDISK or Microsoft Windows NT Disk Administrator. These tools are not aware of GUID Partition Table and do not know how to properly access a GUID Partition Table disk. Legacy software that does not know about GUID Partition Table interprets only the Protected MBR when it accesses a GUID Partition Table disk. These tools will view a GUID Partition Table disk as having a single encompassing (possibly unrecognized) partition by interpreting the Protected MBR, rather than mistaking the disk for one that is unpartitioned. If this occurred, you must have used an MBR-only-aware disk tool to access the GUID Partition Table disk. The EE partition in the Protective MBR is specified to be the maximum size that is allowable in an MBR. Can the 64-bit version of Windows XP read, write, and boot from GUID Partition Table disks? The 64-bit version of Windows XP can read and write GUID Partition Table disks, but cannot boot from GUID Partition Table disks. Can the 64-bit version of Windows XP read, write, and boot from MBR disks? Yes. Can the 32-bit version of Windows XP read, write, and boot from GUID Partition Table disks? No. The 32-bit version will see only the Protective MBR. The EE partition will not be mounted or otherwise exposed to program software. Can the 32-bit version of Windows XP read, write, and boot from MBR disks? Yes. Can Microsoft Windows 2000, Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, or Microsoft Windows 98/95 read, write, and boot from GUID Partition Table? No. Legacy software will see only the Protective MBR. GUID Partition Table and MBR disks can be mixed only on 64-bit systems, and the following restrictions apply: The Windows XP loader and the boot partition must reside on a GUID Partition Table disk. Other hard disks can be either MBR or GUID Partition Table. Both MBR and GUID Partition Table disks can be present in a single dynamic disk group. Volume sets can span both MBR and GUID Partition Table disks, however, the MBR cylinder alignment restriction might cause some difficulties with mirroring or striping MBR and GUID Partition Table disks. Removable media must be MBR orsuperfloppy. Removable media without either GUID Partition Table or MBR formatting is considered a superfloppy. The entire media is treated as a single partition. The media manufacturer performs any MBR partitioning of removable media; Windows never partitions removable media. If the media does have an MBR, only one partition is supported. There is little user-discernible difference between MBR-partitioned media and superfloppies. Examples of removable media include floppy disks, JAZZ disk cartridges, magneto-optical media, DVD-ROM, and CD-ROM. Hard disk drives on external buses such as SCSI or IEEE 1394 are not considered removable. What is the default behavior of the 64-bit version of Windows XP when partitioning media? Fixed disks are partitioned by using GUID Partition Table partitioning. GUID Partition Table disks can be converted to MBR disks only if all existing partitioning is first deleted, with associated loss of data. What is the default behavior of the 32-bit version of Windows XP when partitioning media? Only MBR disks can be used. MBR disks cannot be converted to GUID Partition Table disks. How can a drive letter in the operating system be mapped to a partition in Extensible Firmware Interface Firmware? There is no inherent mapping between drive letter and partition that can be used to determine one from the other. A basic data partition must be identified by its partition GUID. How can an Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition be created? Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions can be created by using the Extensible Firmware Interface firmware utility Diskpart.efi or the Windows XP command-line utility Diskpart.exe, or they can be created programmatically by using IOCTL_SET_DRIVE_LAYOUT . You should not change any partition header entry directly. Do not use disk tools or utilities to make alterations or changes. Detachable disks are commonly expected to migrate between computers or simply to be unavailable to the operating system at times. Examples of detachable disks are IEEE 1394 disks, which can be easily disconnected by the end user, or Microsoft Cluster Services (MSCS) shared disks, which move between nodes in a cluster. Windows XP supports only MBR partitioning on detachable disks. What is the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition? The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition contains the NTLDR, Boot.ini, and other files that are necessary to boot the computer, such as drivers. The Partition GUID defines the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition: DEFINE_GUID (PARTITION_SYSTEM_GUID, 0xC12A7328L, 0xF81F, 0x11D2, 0xBA, 0x4B, 0x00, 0xA0, 0xC9, 0x3E, 0xC9, 0x3B) Do only GUID Partition Table disks have Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions? No, MBR disks can also have Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions. Extensible Firmware Interface specifies booting from either GUID Partition Table or MBR. The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions on an MBR disk is identified by partition type 0xEF. However, Windows XP does not support booting Extensible Firmware Interface from MBR disks or 0xEF partitions. How big is the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition? The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is determined by using the following algorithm: Max (100MB, min (1 percent of physical disk, 1GB)) In other words, the size of the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition must be the larger of these two numbers, 100 MB or 1 percent of the physical disk size (up to 1 GB). The physical disk size is measured at the time of disk partitioning. The value 1 percent of the physical disk is calculated at the time that the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is created and does not change if the disk is extended later (for example, by using RAID). Can there be two Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions on a single disk? Such a configuration should not be created and will not be supported. What about two Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions on two different disks? Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions can be replicated for high-availability configurations. Replication must be done manually and the contents must be synchronized manually. Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions cannot be mirrored. What does Microsoft place in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition? Microsoft places the loader, and other files that are necessary to boot the operating system in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. Where should the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition be placed on the disk? The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition must be first on the disk. While there is no architectural requirement, there are numerous reasons why it is beneficial to place the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition first. The primary reason for this is that it is impossible to span volumes when the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is logically between the two data partitions you are attempting to span. What should a computer or device manufacturer place in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition? The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition should only include files that are required for booting an operating system, platform tools that run before operating system boot, or files that must be accessed before operating system boot, for example in performing pre-boot system maintenance. Other value-added files or diagnostics that are used while the operating system is running should not be placed in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. It is important to note that the space in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is a limited system resource; its primary purpose is to provide storage for the files that are necessary to boot the operating system. The preferred option is for computer manufacturers to place value-added contents in an OEM-specific partition. Just like MBR OEM partitions, the contents of GUID Partition Table OEM (or other unrecognized) partitions are not exposed (given drive letters or returned in volume lists). Users are warned that deleting the partition can cause the computer to fail to operate. An OEM-specific partition should be placed before the Microsoft Reserved Partition and after any Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition on the disk. Although not architectural, this placement has the same benefits as placing the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition first. For example, it is also impossible to span volumes when an OEM-specific partition is logically between the two data partitions you are attempting to span. Placement in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is an option for programs or files that run in the pre-operating system boot environment. However, the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is architecturally-shared space and represents a limited resource. Consuming space in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition should be considered carefully. Files that are not relevant to the pre-operating system boot environment should not be placed in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. What is a Microsoft Reserved Partition? The Microsoft Reserved Partition reserves space on each disk drive for subsequent use by operating system software. GUID Partition Table disks do not allow hidden sectors. Software components that formerly used hidden sectors now allocate portions of the Microsoft Reserved Partition for component-specific partitions. For example, converting a basic disk to a dynamic disk causes the Microsoft Reserved Partition on that disk to be reduced in size and a newly created partition holds the dynamic disk database. The Microsoft Reserved Partition has the following Partition GUID: DEFINE_GUID (PARTITION_MSFT_RESERVED_GUID, 0xE3C9E316L, 0x0B5C, 0x4DB8, 0x81, 0x7D, 0xF9, 0x2D, 0xF0, 0x02, 0x15, 0xAE What disks require a Microsoft Reserved Partition? Every GUID Partition Table disk must contain a Microsoft Reserved Partition. The Microsoft Reserved Partition must be the first partition after the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition (if any) on the disk. It is particularly important that the Microsoft Reserved Partition be created before other primary data partitions. Who creates the Microsoft Reserved Partition? The Microsoft Reserved Partition must be created when disk-partitioning information is first written to the drive. If the manufacturer partitions the disk, the manufacturer must create the Microsoft Reserved Partition at the same time. If Windows partitions the disk during Setup, it creates the Microsoft Reserved Partition. Why must the Microsoft Reserved Partition be created when the disk is first partitioned? After the disk is partitioned, there will be no free space left to create a Microsoft Reserved Partition. How big is the Microsoft Reserved Partition? When initially created, the size of the Microsoft Reserved Partition depends on the size of the disk drive: Each bootable drive must contain an Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition, a Microsoft Reserved Partition, and at least one basic data partition that contains the operating system. Each data drive must contain at least a Microsoft Reserved Partition and one basic data partition. All basic data partitions on the drive should be contiguous. As previously noted, placing an OEM-specific or other unrecognized partition between data partitions imposes limitations on later volume spanning Basic data partitions correspond to primary MBR partitions 0x6 (FAT), 0x7 (NTFS), or 0xB (FAT32). There is a direct one-to-one correlation between a basic data partition and a drive letter or mount point, other volume device object, or both. Each basic data partition is represented in Windows as a volume device object, and optionally as a mount point or a drive letter. It has the following partition type GUID: DEFINE_GUID (PARTITION_BASIC_DATA_GUID, 0xEBD0A0A2L, 0xB9E5, 0x4433, 0x87, 0xC0, 0x68, 0xB6, 0xB7, 0x26, 0x99, 0xC7) The user won't see these partitions exposed in Windows Explorer, nor is any recognized file system exposed to legacy programs such as Context Indexing. The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition, OEM-specific, and other unrecognized partitions will be visible only in the Disk Management MMC snap-in. Windows XP exposes only basic data partitions. Other partitions with FAT file systems may be mounted, but not exposed (only programmatically). Only basic data partitions are assigned drive letters or mount points. The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition FAT file system is mounted, but not exposed. This allows programs running under Windows to update the contents of the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. The following registry key locates the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/System/Setup/SystemPartition The Microsoft Reserved Partition (and any partitions that are created from the Microsoft Reserved Partition) could have recognizable file systems; none are exposed. Any OEM-specific partitions or partitions that are associated with other operating systems are not recognized by Windows. Unrecognized partitions with recognizable file systems are treated like the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. They will be mounted, but not exposed. Unlike MBR disks, there is no practical difference between OEM-specific partitions and other operating system partitions; all are unrecognized. The user can use disk management tools such as the Disk Management MMC snap-in or Diskpart.exe. The Microsoft Reserved Partition and any partitions that are created from the Microsoft Reserved Partition are only visible from a command prompt. Dynamic disks use two different GUID Partition Table partitions: A data container partition corresponding to the MBR partition 0x42, with the following GUID:DEFINE_GUID (PARTITION_LDM_DATA_GUID, 0xAF9B60A0L, 0x1431, 0x4F62, 0xBC, 0x68, 0x33, 0x11, 0x71, 0x4A, 0x69, 0xAD) A partition to contain the dynamic configuration database, with the following GUID:DEFINE_GUID(PARTITION_LDM_METADATA_GUID, 0x5808C8AAL, 0x7E8F, 0x42E0, 0x85, 0xD2, 0xE1, 0xE9, 0x04, 0x34, 0xCF, 0xB3)
Volumes are created in the data container and are mounted by default. This is the same as the contents of 0x42 MBR partitions. For a drive to be eligible for conversion to dynamic, all basic data partitions on the drive must be contiguous. If other unrecognized partitions separate basic data partitions, the disk cannot be converted. This is one of the reasons that the Microsoft Reserved Partition must be created before any basic data partitions. The first step in conversion is to separate a portion of the Microsoft Reserved Partition to create the configuration database partition. All non-bootable basic partitions are then combined into a single data container partition. Boot partitions are retained as separate data container partitions. This is analogous to conversion of primary partitions. Windows XP differs from Windows 2000 in that basic and extended partitions are preferentially converted to a single 0x42 partition, rather than being retained as multiple distinct 0x42 partitions as on Windows 2000. You can access the GUID Partition Table disk partitions of different types by using the following tools. Diskpart.efi:Firmware: Extensible Firmware Interface System PartitionMicrosoft Reserved Partition Diskpart.exe:Windows XP: Extensible Firmware Interface System PartitionMicrosoft Reserved Partition Diskgmt.msc:Windows XP: Extensible Firmware Interface System PartitionDATA Explorer.exe:Windows XP: DATA You can also develop your own tools (by using the Microsoft Win32 or Microsoft Win64 APIs) to access the GUID Partition Table disk partitions at their primitive levels. GUID Partition Table and MBR disks are managed the same way. Disks can be formatted as GUID Partition Table or MBR by using the Diskpart.exe command-line utility or by using the Disk Management snap-in. Volumes can be created on both GUID Partition Table and MBR disks, and both kinds of disks can be mixed in the same dynamic disk group. There is no FTdisk set support on Windows XP for MBR or GUID Partition Table disks. The only support for logical volumes is through dynamic disks. Yes, but only if the disk contains no partitions or volumes. Any data on the disk will be destroyed. GUID Partition Table disks are only supported on the 64-bit version of Windows XP. NTFS is recommended on all basic data partitions and all dynamic volumes. Windows Setup and the Disk Management snap-in offer only NTFS. However, you can still use FAT16 and FAT32 on these partitions as well. To circumvent this, the partition or volume must be formatted explicitly by using the Format tool. No. The Disk and Partition GUIDs will no longer be unique. This must never happen. You can make a sector-by-sector copy of the contents of Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition or basic data partitions. Yes; however, there are some key caveats. The OEM Preinstallation Kit (OPK) initializes the Disk and Partition GUIDs to zero. On first boot of Windows XP, the operating system generates unique GUIDs. The OPK only supports generation of Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition, Microsoft Reserved Partition, and basic data partitions. If a program has recorded any Disk or Partition GUIDs, the program may not work. Any programs, drivers, utilities, or firmware implementations that are supplied by computer manufacturers or program vendors that rely on GUIDs should be capable of handling GUIDs that change from the OPK initialization values to those that are generated by the operating system. It is a way for OEMs to simplify operating system pre-installation and system recovery. This command can easily be extended to create a default disk configuration for the platform. For example, the computer manufacturer could extend the MAKE command to automatically partition the boot drive with an Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition, Microsoft Reserved Partition, an OEM-specific partition, and one basic data partition. For example, consider a possible disk configuration called BOOT_DISK. In the event of disaster recovery, MAKE BOOT_DISK would allow the customer to completely repartition a boot disk to the original factory defaults. Windows XP will generate new GUIDs for any duplicate Disk GUID, Microsoft Reserved Partition GUID, or Microsoft Reserved Partition basic data GUID upon detection. This is similar to the duplicate MBR signature handling in Windows 2000. Duplicate GUIDs on a dynamic container or database partition cause unpredictable results. This depends on the cluster size that is selected at the time of formatting. NTFS is currently limited to 2^32-1 allocation units. This yields a 256TB volume, using 64k clusters. However, this has only been tested to 16TB, or 17,592,186,040,320 bytes, using 4K cluster size. The following chart shows the NTFS limits based on cluster size: For example, to format a volume that has a cluster size of 8 KB, you would use a command such as the following from a command prompt, where/a: ####specifies the number of bytes per cluster: If you choose a cluster size that is too small for the size of the partition, you receive the following error message when you try to format the partition: The format operation did not complete because the cluster count is higher than expected To determine the cluster size of a volume, run the following command at a command prompt, and then note theBytes Per Clustervalue: Note The <volume> placeholder represents the volume letter.

Is there any user impact when switching the Firmware from CSM enabled with Legacy BIOS boot (Config #3) to CSM enabled UEFI boot (Config #2) and back?,"This depends on how you go about switching. If you change from Config #3 to Config #2, then attempt to boot, system may not boot. If you change back to Config #3 at this point, WITHOUT ANY FURTHER CHANGES TO SYSTEM, DISK or OS. Than you should be able to boot back into original OS, using the original Config #n. The recommendation is to  not  change the BIOS setting and instead upgrade ""as-is"".","This article provides a list of frequently asked questions about the GUID Partition Table disk architecture. Applies to:Windows Server 2012 R2Original KB number:302873 Important This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, seeHow to back up and restore the registry in Windows. The GUID Partition Table disk architecture was introduced as part of the Extensible Firmware Interface initiative. GUID Partition Table is a new disk architecture that expands on the older Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning scheme that has been common to Intel-based computers. A partition is a contiguous space of storage on a physical or logical disk that functions as though it were a physically separate disk. Partitions are visible to the system firmware and the installed operating systems. Access to a partition is controlled by the system firmware and the operating system that is currently active. GUID Partition Table disks can grow to a large size. As of July 2001, the Microsoft implementation supports a hard disk of up to 18 EB (512 KB LBAs). The number of partitions on a GUID Partition Table disk is not constrained by temporary schemes such as container partitions as defined by the MBR Extended Boot Record. The Microsoft implementation of GUID Partition Table is limited to 128 partitions. However, it is important to note that one partition is used for the EFI System Partition, one for the Microsoft Reserved and two more are used if you use dynamic disks. This leaves 124 partitions for data use. The GUID Partition Table disk partition format is well defined and fully self-identifying. Data that is critical to the operating system is located in partitions and not in unpartitioned orhiddensectors. GUID Partition Table does not allow for hidden sectors or partitions. GUID Partition Table disks use primary and backup partition tables for redundancy and CRC32 fields for improved partition data structure integrity. The GUID Partition Table partition format uses version number and size fields for future expansion. Each GUID Partition Table partition has a unique identification GUID and a partition content type, so no coordination is necessary to prevent partition identifier collision. Each GUID Partition Table partition has a 36-character Unicode name, which means that any software can present an easily readable name for the partition without any additional understanding of the partition. MBR disks support only four primary partitions table entries or multiple logical partitions in the extended partition. If more partitions are wanted, a secondary structure, an extended partition, is necessary. Extended partitions are then subdivided into one or more logical disks. Only one extended partition can be present on any given drive, and the maximum number of logical drives is MAXULONG/4. All MBR disk partitions and logical drives must be cylinder-aligned, even on hardware RAID sets that are built from multiple different drives with no clear underlying physical geometry. MBR partitioning rules are complex and poorly specified. For example, does cylinder alignment mean that each partition must be at least one cylinder in length? An MBR partition is identified by a two-byte field, and coordination is necessary to avoid collision. IBM originally provided that coordination, but as of July 2001, there is no single authoritative list of partition identifiers. Another common practice is to use partitioned or ""hidden"" sectors to hold specific information. That practice is undocumented and results in severe system problems that are difficult to debug. Over the years, broken implementations and tools have been released to the public, making support difficult. Chapter 16 of the Extensible Firmware Interface specification defines the GUID Partition Table format. This document is available at the following Intel Web site: The Unified EFI Specification Defines an Interface Between an Operating System and Platform Firmware Third-party information disclaimer The third-party products that this article discusses are manufactured by companies that are independent of Microsoft. Microsoft makes no warranty, implied or otherwise, about the performance or reliability of these products. No. GUID Partition Table disks are self-identifying. All the information that is needed to interpret the partitioning scheme of a GUID Partition Table disk is completely contained in structures in specified locations on the physical media. In theory, a GUID Partition Table disk can be up to 264 sectors in a single logical block in length. Logical blocks are commonly 512 bytes or one sector in size. In practice, Windows XP supports GUID Partition Table disks of up to approximately 18 exabytes in size. In theory, an unlimited number. As the July 2001, the Microsoft implementation is 128 partitions. The number of partitions is limited by the amount of space that is reserved for making partition entries. No. However, all GUID Partition Table disks contain a protective MBR that is used for legacy programs that do not understand the GUID Partition Table disk structure. The Protective MBR, beginning in sector 0, precedes the GUID Partition Table partition table on the disk. The MBR contains one type 0xEE partition that spans the entire length of the disk. This is the same regardless of the number of partitions that are defined in the GUID Partition Table disk entry array. The Protective MBR protects GUID Partition Table disks from previously-released MBR disk tools such as Microsoft MS-DOS FDISK or Microsoft Windows NT Disk Administrator. These tools are not aware of GUID Partition Table and do not know how to properly access a GUID Partition Table disk. Legacy software that does not know about GUID Partition Table interprets only the Protected MBR when it accesses a GUID Partition Table disk. These tools will view a GUID Partition Table disk as having a single encompassing (possibly unrecognized) partition by interpreting the Protected MBR, rather than mistaking the disk for one that is unpartitioned. If this occurred, you must have used an MBR-only-aware disk tool to access the GUID Partition Table disk. The EE partition in the Protective MBR is specified to be the maximum size that is allowable in an MBR. Can the 64-bit version of Windows XP read, write, and boot from GUID Partition Table disks? The 64-bit version of Windows XP can read and write GUID Partition Table disks, but cannot boot from GUID Partition Table disks. Can the 64-bit version of Windows XP read, write, and boot from MBR disks? Yes. Can the 32-bit version of Windows XP read, write, and boot from GUID Partition Table disks? No. The 32-bit version will see only the Protective MBR. The EE partition will not be mounted or otherwise exposed to program software. Can the 32-bit version of Windows XP read, write, and boot from MBR disks? Yes. Can Microsoft Windows 2000, Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, or Microsoft Windows 98/95 read, write, and boot from GUID Partition Table? No. Legacy software will see only the Protective MBR. GUID Partition Table and MBR disks can be mixed only on 64-bit systems, and the following restrictions apply: The Windows XP loader and the boot partition must reside on a GUID Partition Table disk. Other hard disks can be either MBR or GUID Partition Table. Both MBR and GUID Partition Table disks can be present in a single dynamic disk group. Volume sets can span both MBR and GUID Partition Table disks, however, the MBR cylinder alignment restriction might cause some difficulties with mirroring or striping MBR and GUID Partition Table disks. Removable media must be MBR orsuperfloppy. Removable media without either GUID Partition Table or MBR formatting is considered a superfloppy. The entire media is treated as a single partition. The media manufacturer performs any MBR partitioning of removable media; Windows never partitions removable media. If the media does have an MBR, only one partition is supported. There is little user-discernible difference between MBR-partitioned media and superfloppies. Examples of removable media include floppy disks, JAZZ disk cartridges, magneto-optical media, DVD-ROM, and CD-ROM. Hard disk drives on external buses such as SCSI or IEEE 1394 are not considered removable. What is the default behavior of the 64-bit version of Windows XP when partitioning media? Fixed disks are partitioned by using GUID Partition Table partitioning. GUID Partition Table disks can be converted to MBR disks only if all existing partitioning is first deleted, with associated loss of data. What is the default behavior of the 32-bit version of Windows XP when partitioning media? Only MBR disks can be used. MBR disks cannot be converted to GUID Partition Table disks. How can a drive letter in the operating system be mapped to a partition in Extensible Firmware Interface Firmware? There is no inherent mapping between drive letter and partition that can be used to determine one from the other. A basic data partition must be identified by its partition GUID. How can an Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition be created? Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions can be created by using the Extensible Firmware Interface firmware utility Diskpart.efi or the Windows XP command-line utility Diskpart.exe, or they can be created programmatically by using IOCTL_SET_DRIVE_LAYOUT . You should not change any partition header entry directly. Do not use disk tools or utilities to make alterations or changes. Detachable disks are commonly expected to migrate between computers or simply to be unavailable to the operating system at times. Examples of detachable disks are IEEE 1394 disks, which can be easily disconnected by the end user, or Microsoft Cluster Services (MSCS) shared disks, which move between nodes in a cluster. Windows XP supports only MBR partitioning on detachable disks. What is the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition? The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition contains the NTLDR, Boot.ini, and other files that are necessary to boot the computer, such as drivers. The Partition GUID defines the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition: DEFINE_GUID (PARTITION_SYSTEM_GUID, 0xC12A7328L, 0xF81F, 0x11D2, 0xBA, 0x4B, 0x00, 0xA0, 0xC9, 0x3E, 0xC9, 0x3B) Do only GUID Partition Table disks have Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions? No, MBR disks can also have Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions. Extensible Firmware Interface specifies booting from either GUID Partition Table or MBR. The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions on an MBR disk is identified by partition type 0xEF. However, Windows XP does not support booting Extensible Firmware Interface from MBR disks or 0xEF partitions. How big is the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition? The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is determined by using the following algorithm: Max (100MB, min (1 percent of physical disk, 1GB)) In other words, the size of the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition must be the larger of these two numbers, 100 MB or 1 percent of the physical disk size (up to 1 GB). The physical disk size is measured at the time of disk partitioning. The value 1 percent of the physical disk is calculated at the time that the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is created and does not change if the disk is extended later (for example, by using RAID). Can there be two Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions on a single disk? Such a configuration should not be created and will not be supported. What about two Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions on two different disks? Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions can be replicated for high-availability configurations. Replication must be done manually and the contents must be synchronized manually. Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions cannot be mirrored. What does Microsoft place in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition? Microsoft places the loader, and other files that are necessary to boot the operating system in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. Where should the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition be placed on the disk? The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition must be first on the disk. While there is no architectural requirement, there are numerous reasons why it is beneficial to place the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition first. The primary reason for this is that it is impossible to span volumes when the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is logically between the two data partitions you are attempting to span. What should a computer or device manufacturer place in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition? The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition should only include files that are required for booting an operating system, platform tools that run before operating system boot, or files that must be accessed before operating system boot, for example in performing pre-boot system maintenance. Other value-added files or diagnostics that are used while the operating system is running should not be placed in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. It is important to note that the space in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is a limited system resource; its primary purpose is to provide storage for the files that are necessary to boot the operating system. The preferred option is for computer manufacturers to place value-added contents in an OEM-specific partition. Just like MBR OEM partitions, the contents of GUID Partition Table OEM (or other unrecognized) partitions are not exposed (given drive letters or returned in volume lists). Users are warned that deleting the partition can cause the computer to fail to operate. An OEM-specific partition should be placed before the Microsoft Reserved Partition and after any Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition on the disk. Although not architectural, this placement has the same benefits as placing the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition first. For example, it is also impossible to span volumes when an OEM-specific partition is logically between the two data partitions you are attempting to span. Placement in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is an option for programs or files that run in the pre-operating system boot environment. However, the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is architecturally-shared space and represents a limited resource. Consuming space in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition should be considered carefully. Files that are not relevant to the pre-operating system boot environment should not be placed in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. What is a Microsoft Reserved Partition? The Microsoft Reserved Partition reserves space on each disk drive for subsequent use by operating system software. GUID Partition Table disks do not allow hidden sectors. Software components that formerly used hidden sectors now allocate portions of the Microsoft Reserved Partition for component-specific partitions. For example, converting a basic disk to a dynamic disk causes the Microsoft Reserved Partition on that disk to be reduced in size and a newly created partition holds the dynamic disk database. The Microsoft Reserved Partition has the following Partition GUID: DEFINE_GUID (PARTITION_MSFT_RESERVED_GUID, 0xE3C9E316L, 0x0B5C, 0x4DB8, 0x81, 0x7D, 0xF9, 0x2D, 0xF0, 0x02, 0x15, 0xAE What disks require a Microsoft Reserved Partition? Every GUID Partition Table disk must contain a Microsoft Reserved Partition. The Microsoft Reserved Partition must be the first partition after the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition (if any) on the disk. It is particularly important that the Microsoft Reserved Partition be created before other primary data partitions. Who creates the Microsoft Reserved Partition? The Microsoft Reserved Partition must be created when disk-partitioning information is first written to the drive. If the manufacturer partitions the disk, the manufacturer must create the Microsoft Reserved Partition at the same time. If Windows partitions the disk during Setup, it creates the Microsoft Reserved Partition. Why must the Microsoft Reserved Partition be created when the disk is first partitioned? After the disk is partitioned, there will be no free space left to create a Microsoft Reserved Partition. How big is the Microsoft Reserved Partition? When initially created, the size of the Microsoft Reserved Partition depends on the size of the disk drive: Each bootable drive must contain an Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition, a Microsoft Reserved Partition, and at least one basic data partition that contains the operating system. Each data drive must contain at least a Microsoft Reserved Partition and one basic data partition. All basic data partitions on the drive should be contiguous. As previously noted, placing an OEM-specific or other unrecognized partition between data partitions imposes limitations on later volume spanning Basic data partitions correspond to primary MBR partitions 0x6 (FAT), 0x7 (NTFS), or 0xB (FAT32). There is a direct one-to-one correlation between a basic data partition and a drive letter or mount point, other volume device object, or both. Each basic data partition is represented in Windows as a volume device object, and optionally as a mount point or a drive letter. It has the following partition type GUID: DEFINE_GUID (PARTITION_BASIC_DATA_GUID, 0xEBD0A0A2L, 0xB9E5, 0x4433, 0x87, 0xC0, 0x68, 0xB6, 0xB7, 0x26, 0x99, 0xC7) The user won't see these partitions exposed in Windows Explorer, nor is any recognized file system exposed to legacy programs such as Context Indexing. The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition, OEM-specific, and other unrecognized partitions will be visible only in the Disk Management MMC snap-in. Windows XP exposes only basic data partitions. Other partitions with FAT file systems may be mounted, but not exposed (only programmatically). Only basic data partitions are assigned drive letters or mount points. The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition FAT file system is mounted, but not exposed. This allows programs running under Windows to update the contents of the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. The following registry key locates the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/System/Setup/SystemPartition The Microsoft Reserved Partition (and any partitions that are created from the Microsoft Reserved Partition) could have recognizable file systems; none are exposed. Any OEM-specific partitions or partitions that are associated with other operating systems are not recognized by Windows. Unrecognized partitions with recognizable file systems are treated like the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. They will be mounted, but not exposed. Unlike MBR disks, there is no practical difference between OEM-specific partitions and other operating system partitions; all are unrecognized. The user can use disk management tools such as the Disk Management MMC snap-in or Diskpart.exe. The Microsoft Reserved Partition and any partitions that are created from the Microsoft Reserved Partition are only visible from a command prompt. Dynamic disks use two different GUID Partition Table partitions: A data container partition corresponding to the MBR partition 0x42, with the following GUID:DEFINE_GUID (PARTITION_LDM_DATA_GUID, 0xAF9B60A0L, 0x1431, 0x4F62, 0xBC, 0x68, 0x33, 0x11, 0x71, 0x4A, 0x69, 0xAD) A partition to contain the dynamic configuration database, with the following GUID:DEFINE_GUID(PARTITION_LDM_METADATA_GUID, 0x5808C8AAL, 0x7E8F, 0x42E0, 0x85, 0xD2, 0xE1, 0xE9, 0x04, 0x34, 0xCF, 0xB3)
Volumes are created in the data container and are mounted by default. This is the same as the contents of 0x42 MBR partitions. For a drive to be eligible for conversion to dynamic, all basic data partitions on the drive must be contiguous. If other unrecognized partitions separate basic data partitions, the disk cannot be converted. This is one of the reasons that the Microsoft Reserved Partition must be created before any basic data partitions. The first step in conversion is to separate a portion of the Microsoft Reserved Partition to create the configuration database partition. All non-bootable basic partitions are then combined into a single data container partition. Boot partitions are retained as separate data container partitions. This is analogous to conversion of primary partitions. Windows XP differs from Windows 2000 in that basic and extended partitions are preferentially converted to a single 0x42 partition, rather than being retained as multiple distinct 0x42 partitions as on Windows 2000. You can access the GUID Partition Table disk partitions of different types by using the following tools. Diskpart.efi:Firmware: Extensible Firmware Interface System PartitionMicrosoft Reserved Partition Diskpart.exe:Windows XP: Extensible Firmware Interface System PartitionMicrosoft Reserved Partition Diskgmt.msc:Windows XP: Extensible Firmware Interface System PartitionDATA Explorer.exe:Windows XP: DATA You can also develop your own tools (by using the Microsoft Win32 or Microsoft Win64 APIs) to access the GUID Partition Table disk partitions at their primitive levels. GUID Partition Table and MBR disks are managed the same way. Disks can be formatted as GUID Partition Table or MBR by using the Diskpart.exe command-line utility or by using the Disk Management snap-in. Volumes can be created on both GUID Partition Table and MBR disks, and both kinds of disks can be mixed in the same dynamic disk group. There is no FTdisk set support on Windows XP for MBR or GUID Partition Table disks. The only support for logical volumes is through dynamic disks. Yes, but only if the disk contains no partitions or volumes. Any data on the disk will be destroyed. GUID Partition Table disks are only supported on the 64-bit version of Windows XP. NTFS is recommended on all basic data partitions and all dynamic volumes. Windows Setup and the Disk Management snap-in offer only NTFS. However, you can still use FAT16 and FAT32 on these partitions as well. To circumvent this, the partition or volume must be formatted explicitly by using the Format tool. No. The Disk and Partition GUIDs will no longer be unique. This must never happen. You can make a sector-by-sector copy of the contents of Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition or basic data partitions. Yes; however, there are some key caveats. The OEM Preinstallation Kit (OPK) initializes the Disk and Partition GUIDs to zero. On first boot of Windows XP, the operating system generates unique GUIDs. The OPK only supports generation of Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition, Microsoft Reserved Partition, and basic data partitions. If a program has recorded any Disk or Partition GUIDs, the program may not work. Any programs, drivers, utilities, or firmware implementations that are supplied by computer manufacturers or program vendors that rely on GUIDs should be capable of handling GUIDs that change from the OPK initialization values to those that are generated by the operating system. It is a way for OEMs to simplify operating system pre-installation and system recovery. This command can easily be extended to create a default disk configuration for the platform. For example, the computer manufacturer could extend the MAKE command to automatically partition the boot drive with an Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition, Microsoft Reserved Partition, an OEM-specific partition, and one basic data partition. For example, consider a possible disk configuration called BOOT_DISK. In the event of disaster recovery, MAKE BOOT_DISK would allow the customer to completely repartition a boot disk to the original factory defaults. Windows XP will generate new GUIDs for any duplicate Disk GUID, Microsoft Reserved Partition GUID, or Microsoft Reserved Partition basic data GUID upon detection. This is similar to the duplicate MBR signature handling in Windows 2000. Duplicate GUIDs on a dynamic container or database partition cause unpredictable results. This depends on the cluster size that is selected at the time of formatting. NTFS is currently limited to 2^32-1 allocation units. This yields a 256TB volume, using 64k clusters. However, this has only been tested to 16TB, or 17,592,186,040,320 bytes, using 4K cluster size. The following chart shows the NTFS limits based on cluster size: For example, to format a volume that has a cluster size of 8 KB, you would use a command such as the following from a command prompt, where/a: ####specifies the number of bytes per cluster: If you choose a cluster size that is too small for the size of the partition, you receive the following error message when you try to format the partition: The format operation did not complete because the cluster count is higher than expected To determine the cluster size of a volume, run the following command at a command prompt, and then note theBytes Per Clustervalue: Note The <volume> placeholder represents the volume letter.

Change from Config #2 to Config #1 to enable Secure Boot:,"For newer systems; post 2015 (Skylake), and if system has CSM enabled, with Secure Boot disabled (they should be mutually exclusive) and OS is installed using UEFI boot method to GPT disk. After upgrading to Win10+, it should be a straightforward process of turning off the CSM and enabling Secure Boot in Firmware (if Secure Boot was setup in the factory and is an option in firmware). 
 If after making the changes, the system is not able to boot, then system is more than likely configured to boot using CSMâs legacy BIOS for boot. If this is the case, this will require either Win10+ installation media, or a clean install of the original operating system (Windows 7). Ensuring that the CSM is enabled and installation/disk partition is set for UEFI boot mode which would later allow upgrade to Win10 in UEFI boot mode. 
 Be sure to select UEFI boot to install media, firmware configuration may require further BIOS setting changes in order to boot to UEFI installation. 
 Consult with PC manufacture for more information concerning boot options and BIOS configuration.","Learn more about BitLocker by reviewing the frequently asked questions. Yes, BitLocker supports multifactor authentication for operating system drives. If BitLocker is enabled on a computer that has a TPM version 1.2 or later, additional forms of authentication can be used with the TPM protection. Two partitions are required to run BitLocker because pre-startup authentication and system integrity verification must occur on a separate partition from the encrypted operating system drive. This configuration helps protect the operating system and the information in the encrypted drive. The TPM status can be checked inWindows Defender Security Center>Device Security>Security processor details. Yes, BitLocker can be enabled on an operating system drive without a TPM, if the BIOS or UEFI firmware has the ability to read from a USB flash drive in the boot environment. BitLocker won't unlock the protected drive until BitLocker's own volume master key is first released by either the computer's TPM or by a USB flash drive containing the BitLocker startup key for that computer. However, computers without TPMs won't be able to use the system integrity verification that BitLocker can also provide.
To help determine whether a computer can read from a USB device during the boot process, use the BitLocker system check as part of the BitLocker setup process. This system check performs tests to confirm that the computer can properly read from the USB devices at the appropriate time and that the computer meets other BitLocker requirements. Contact the computer manufacturer to request a Trusted Computing Group (TCG)-compliant BIOS or UEFI boot firmware that meets the following requirements: To turn on, turn off, or change configurations of BitLocker on operating system and fixed data drives, membership to the localAdministratorsgroup is required. Standard users can turn on, turn off, or change configurations of BitLocker on removable data drives. The computer's startup options should be configured to have the hard disk drive first in the boot order, before any other drives such as CD/DVD drives or USB drives. If the hard disk isn't first and the computer typically boots from the hard disk, then a boot order change may be detected or assumed when removable media is found during boot. The boot order typically affects the system measurement that is verified by BitLocker and a change in boot order will cause a prompt for the BitLocker recovery key. For the same reason, if a laptop is used with a docking station, ensure that the hard disk drive is first in the boot order both when the laptop is docked and undocked. Yes. Decryptcompletely removes BitLocker protection and fully decrypts the drive. Suspendkeeps the data encrypted but encrypts the BitLocker volume master key with a clear key. The clear key is a cryptographic key stored unencrypted and unprotected on the disk drive. By storing this key unencrypted, theSuspendoption allows for changes or upgrades to the computer without the time and cost of decrypting and re-encrypting the entire drive. After the changes are made and BitLocker is again enabled, BitLocker will reseal the encryption key to the new values of the measured components that changed as a part of the upgrade, the volume master key is changed, the protectors are updated to match and the clear key is erased. No user action is required for BitLocker in order to apply updates from Microsoft, includingWindows quality updates and feature updates.
Users need to suspend BitLocker for Non-Microsoft software updates, such as: Note If BitLocker is suspended, you can resume BitLocker protection after the upgrade or update is installed. Upon resuming protection, BitLocker will reseal the encryption key to the new values of the measured components that changed as a part of the upgrade or update. If these types of upgrades or updates are applied without suspending BitLocker, the computer will enter recovery mode when restarting and will require a recovery key or password to access the computer. Yes, the deployment and configuration BitLocker can be automated using either Windows PowerShell or with themanage-bde.execommand. For more information about common BitLocker management commands, check theBitLocker operations guide. Typically, there's a small performance overhead, often in single-digit percentages, which is relative to the throughput of the storage operations on which it needs to operate. Although BitLocker encryption occurs in the background while a user continues to work with the system remaining usable, encryption times vary depending on the type of drive that is being encrypted, the size of the drive, and the speed of the drive. If encrypting large drives, encryption may want to be scheduled during times when the drive isn't being used. When BitLocker is enabled, BitLocker can also be set to encrypt the entire drive or just the used space on the drive. On a new hard drive, encrypting just the used spaced can be considerably faster than encrypting the entire drive. When this encryption option is selected, BitLocker automatically encrypts data as it is saved, ensuring that no data is stored unencrypted. If the computer is turned off or goes into hibernation, the BitLocker encryption and decryption process will resume where it stopped the next time Windows starts. BitLocker resuming encryption or decryption is true even if the power is suddenly unavailable. No, BitLocker doesn't encrypt and decrypt the entire drive when reading and writing data. The encrypted sectors in the BitLocker-protected drive are decrypted only as they're requested from system read operations. Blocks that are written to the drive are encrypted before the system writes them to the physical disk. No unencrypted data is ever stored on a BitLocker-protected drive. Policy settings can be configured to require that data drives be BitLocker-protected before a BitLocker-protected computer can write data to them. For more info, seeBitLocker policy settings.
When these policy settings are enabled, the BitLocker-protected operating system will mount any data drives that aren't protected by BitLocker as read-only. BitLocker lets users choose to encrypt just their data. Although it's not the most secure way to encrypt a drive, this option can reduce encryption time by more than 99 percent, depending on how much data that needs to be encrypted. For more information, seeUsed Disk Space Only encryption. The following types of system changes can cause an integrity check failure and prevent the TPM from releasing the BitLocker key to decrypt the protected operating system drive: Because BitLocker is designed to protect computers from numerous attacks, there are numerous reasons why BitLocker could start in recovery mode.
For example: In BitLocker, recovery consists of decrypting a copy of the volume master key using either a recovery key stored on a USB flash drive or a cryptographic key derived from a recovery password.
The TPM isn't involved in any recovery scenarios, so recovery is still possible if the TPM fails boot component validation, malfunctions, or is removed. BitLocker can be prevented from binding to PCR 7 if a non-Windows OS booted prior to Windows, or if Secure Boot isn't available to the device, either because it's disabled or the hardware doesn't support it. Yes, multiple hard disks can be swapped on the same computer if BitLocker is enabled, but only if the hard disks were BitLocker-protected on the same computer. The BitLocker keys are unique to the TPM and the operating system drive. If a backup operating system or data drive needs to be prepared in case of a disk failure, make sure that they were matched with the correct TPM. Different hard drives can also be configured for different operating systems and then enable BitLocker on each one with different authentication methods (such as one with TPM-only and one with TPM+PIN) without any conflicts. Yes, if the drive is a data drive, it can be unlocked from theBitLocker Drive EncryptionControl Panel item by using a password or smart card. If the data drive was configured for automatic unlock only, it will need to be unlocked by using the recovery key. The encrypted hard disk can be unlocked by a data recovery agent (if one was configured) or it can be unlocked by using the recovery key. Some drives can't be encrypted with BitLocker. Reasons a drive can't be encrypted include insufficient disk size, an incompatible file system, if the drive is a dynamic disk, or a drive is designated as the system partition. By default, the system drive (or system partition) is hidden from display. However, if it isn't created as a hidden drive when the operating system was installed due to a custom installation process, that drive might be displayed but can't be encrypted. Any number of internal, fixed data drives can be protected with BitLocker. On some versions ATA and SATA-based, direct-attached storage devices are also supported. Removable data drives can be unlocked using a password or a smart card. A SID protector can also be configured to unlock a drive by using user domain credentials. After encryption has started, the drive can also be automatically unlocked on a specific computer for a specific user account. System administrators can configure which options are available for users including password complexity and minimum length requirements. To unlock by using a SID protector, usemanage-bde.exe: There are multiple keys that can be generated and used by BitLocker. Some keys are required and some are optional protectors you can choose to use depending on the level of security you require. TPM owner password Prior to enabling BitLocker on a computer with a TPM version 1.2, you must initialize the TPM. The initialization process generates a TPM owner password, which is a password set on the TPM. You must be able to supply the TPM owner password to change the state of the TPM, such as when enabling or disabling the TPM or resetting the TPM lockout. Recovery password and recovery key When you set up BitLocker, you must choose how access to BitLocker-protected drives can be recovered in the event that the specified unlock method cannot be used (such as if the TPM cannot validate the boot components, the personal identification number (PIN) is forgotten, or the password is forgotten). In these situations, you must be able to supply either the recovery key or the recovery password to unlock the encrypted data on the drive. When you supply the recovery information, you can use either of the following formats: PIN and enhanced PIN For a higher level of security with the TPM, you can configure BitLocker with a personal identification number (PIN). The PIN is a user-created value that must be entered each time the computer starts or resumes from hibernation. The PIN can consist of 4 to 20 digits as specified by theConfigure minimum PIN length for startuppolicy setting and is stored internally as a 256-bit hash of the entered Unicode characters. This value is never displayed to the user. The PIN is used to provide another factor of authentication in conjunction with TPM authentication.For an even higher level of security with the TPM, you can configure BitLocker to use enhanced PINs. Enhanced PINs are PINs that use the full keyboard character set in addition to the numeric set to allow for more possible PIN combinations and are between 4 and 20 characters in length. To use enhanced PINs, you must enable theAllow enhanced PINs for startuppolicy setting before adding the PIN to the drive. By enabling this policy, all PINs created can utilize full keyboard characters. Startup key Configuring a startup key is another method to enable a higher level of security with the TPM. The startup key is a key stored on a USB flash drive, and the USB flash drive must be inserted every time the computer starts. The startup key is used to provide another factor of authentication in conjunction with TPM authentication. To use a USB flash drive as a startup key, the USB flash drive must be formatted by using the NTFS, FAT, or FAT32 file system. Important You must have a startup key to use BitLocker on a non-TPM computer. The recovery password and recovery key for an operating system drive or a fixed data drive can be saved to a folder, saved to one or more USB devices, saved to a Microsoft Account, or printed. For removable data drives, the recovery password and recovery key can be saved to a folder, saved to a Microsoft Account, or printed. By default, a recovery key for a removable drive can't be stored on a removable drive. A domain administrator can also configure policy settings to automatically generate recovery passwords and store them in Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) or Microsoft Entra ID for any BitLocker-protected drive. TheManage-bde.execommand-line tool can be used to replace TPM-only authentication mode with a multifactor authentication mode. For example, if BitLocker is enabled with TPM authentication only and PIN authentication needs to be added, use the following commands from an elevated Command Prompt, replacing4-20 digit numeric PINwith the desired numeric PIN: New hardware that meetsWindows Hardware Compatibility Programrequirements make a PIN less critical as a mitigation, and having a TPM-only protector is likely sufficient when combined with policies like device lockout. For example, Surface Pro and Surface Book don't have external DMA ports to attack.
For older hardware, where a PIN may be needed, it's recommended to enableenhanced PINsthat allow non-numeric characters such as letters and punctuation marks, and to set the PIN length based on the risk tolerance and the hardware anti-hammering capabilities available to the TPMs on the computers. BitLocker is designed to make the encrypted drive unrecoverable without the required authentication. When in recovery mode, the user needs the recovery password or recovery key to unlock the encrypted drive. Important Store the recovery information in Microsoft Entra ID, AD DS, Microsoft Account, or another safe location. While using a USB flash drive as both the startup key and for storage of the recovery key is technically possible, it isn't a best practice to use one USB flash drive to store both keys. If the USB flash drive that contains the startup key is lost or stolen, the recovery key will also be lost. In addition, inserting this key would cause the computer to automatically boot from the recovery key even if TPM-measured files have changed, which circumvents the TPM's system integrity check. Yes, computer's startup key can be saved on multiple USB flash drives. Right-clicking a BitLocker-protected drive and selectingManage BitLockerwill provide the options to save the recovery keys on additional USB flash drives as needed. Yes, BitLocker startup keys for different  computers can be saved on the same USB flash drive. Generating different startup keys for the same computer can be done through scripting. However, for computers that have a TPM, creating different startup keys prevents BitLocker from using the TPM's system integrity check. Generating multiple PIN combinations can't be done. Raw data is encrypted with the full volume encryption key, which is then encrypted with the volume master key. The volume master key is in turn encrypted by one of several possible methods depending on the authentication (that is, key protectors or TPM) and recovery scenarios. The full volume encryption key is encrypted by the volume master key and stored in the encrypted drive. The volume master key is encrypted by the appropriate key protector and stored in the encrypted drive. If BitLocker has been suspended, the clear key that is used to encrypt the volume master key is also stored in the encrypted drive, along with the encrypted volume master key. This storage process ensures that the volume master key is never stored unencrypted and is protected unless BitLocker is disabled. The keys are also saved to two additional locations on the drive for redundancy. The keys can be read and processed by the boot manager. The F1 through F10 keys are universally mapped scan codes available in the pre-boot environment on all computers and in all languages. The numeric keys 0 through 9 aren't usable in the pre-boot environment on all keyboards. When using an enhanced PIN, users should run the optional system check during the BitLocker setup process to ensure that the PIN can be entered correctly in the pre-boot environment. It's possible that a personal identification number (PIN) can be discovered by an attacker performing a brute force attack. A brute force attack occurs when an attacker uses an automated tool to try different PIN combinations until the correct one is discovered. For BitLocker-protected computers, this type of attack, also known as a dictionary attack, requires that the attacker has physical access to the computer. The TPM has the built-in ability to detect and react to these types of attacks. Because different manufacturers' TPMs may support different PIN and attack mitigations, contact the TPM's manufacturer to determine how the computer's TPM mitigates PIN brute force attacks.
After the TPM's manufacturer is determined, contact the manufacturer to gather the TPM's vendor-specific information. Most manufacturers use the PIN authentication failure count to exponentially increase lockout time to the PIN interface. However, each manufacturer has different policies regarding when and how the failure counter is decreased or reset. The TPM manufacturer can be determined inWindows Defender Security Center>Device Security>Security processor details. The following questions can assist when asking a TPM manufacturer about the design of a dictionary attack mitigation mechanism: The minimum personal identification number (PIN) length can be configured by using theConfigure minimum PIN length for startupGroup Policy setting and allow the use of alphanumeric PINs by enabling theAllow enhanced PINs for startuppolicy setting. PIN complexity can't be required via policy settings. For more info, seeBitLocker policy settings. BitLocker hashes the user-specified personal identification number (PIN) by using SHA-256, and the first 160 bits of the hash are used as authorization data sent to the TPM to seal the volume master key. The volume master key is now protected by both the TPM and the PIN. To unseal the volume master key, you are required to enter the PIN each time the computer restarts or resumes from hibernation. BitLocker To Go is BitLocker Drive Encryption on removable data drives. This feature includes the encryption of: Drive partitioning must meet theBitLocker Drive Encryption Partitioning Requirements. As with BitLocker, drives that are encrypted by BitLocker To Go can be opened by using a password or smart card on another computer. In Control Panel, useBitLocker Drive Encryption. If BitLocker is enabled on a drive before policy settings are applied to enforce a backup, the recovery information won't be automatically backed up to AD DS when the computer joins the domain or when the policy settings are subsequently applied. However, the policy settingsChoose how BitLocker-protected operating system drives can be recovered,Choose how BitLocker-protected fixed drives can be recovered, andChoose how BitLocker-protected removable drives can be recoveredcan be chosen to require the computer to be connected to a domain before BitLocker can be enabled to help ensure that recovery information for BitLocker-protected drives in the organization is backed up to AD DS. For more information how to back up the recovery password to AD DS or Microsoft Entra ID, review theBitLocker operations guide. Important Joining a computer to the domain should be the first step for new computers within an organization. After computers are joined to a domain, storing the BitLocker recovery key to AD DS is automatic (when enabled with policy settings). Yes, an event log entry that indicates the success or failure of a backup is recorded on the client computer. However, even if an event log entry says ""Success,"" the information could have been subsequently removed from AD DS, or BitLocker could have been reconfigured in such a way that the Active Directory information can no longer unlock the drive (such as by removing the recovery password key protector). In addition, it's also possible that the log entry could be spoofed. Ultimately, determining whether a legitimate backup exists in AD DS requires querying AD DS with domain administrator credentials by using the BitLocker password viewer tool. No. By design, BitLocker recovery password entries don't get deleted from AD DS. Therefore, multiple passwords might be seen for each drive. To identify the latest password, check the date on the object. If the backup initially fails, such as when a domain controller is unreachable at the time when the BitLocker setup wizard is run, BitLocker doesn't try again to back up the recovery information to AD DS. When an administrator selects theDo not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for (operating system | fixed data | removable data) drivescheck box in any of theChoose how BitLocker-protected operating system drives can be recovered,Choose how BitLocker-protected fixed data drives can be recovered, andChoose how BitLocker-protected removable data drives can be recoveredpolicy settings, users can't enable BitLocker unless the computer is connected to the domain and the backup of BitLocker recovery information to AD DS succeeds. With these settings configured if the backup fails, BitLocker can't be enabled, ensuring that administrators will be able to recover BitLocker-protected drives in the organization. For more info, seeBitLocker policy settings. When an administrator clears these check boxes, the administrator is allowing a drive to be BitLocker-protected without having the recovery information successfully backed up to AD DS; however, BitLocker won't automatically retry the backup if it fails. Instead, administrators can create a backup script, as described earlier inWhat if BitLocker is enabled on a computer before the computer joins the domain?to capture the information after connectivity is restored. BitLocker uses Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) as its encryption algorithm with configurable key lengths of 128 bits or 256 bits. The default encryption setting is AES-128, but the options are configurable by using policy settings. The recommended practice for BitLocker configuration on an operating system drive is to implement BitLocker on a computer with a TPM version 1.2 or higher. BitLocker on operating system drives in its basic configuration provides extra security for the hibernate mode. In sleep mode, the computer is vulnerable to direct memory access attacks, since unprotected data remains in RAM. Therefore, for improved security, it's recommended to disable sleep mode. Startup authentication can be configured by using apolicy setting. Most operating systems use a shared memory space and rely on the operating system to manage physical memory. A TPM is a hardware component that uses its own internal firmware and logic circuits for processing instructions, thus shielding it from external software vulnerabilities. Attacking the TPM requires physical access to the computer. Additionally, the tools and skills necessary to attack hardware are often more expensive, and usually aren't as available as the ones used to attack software. And because each TPM is unique to the computer that contains it, attacking multiple TPM computers would be difficult and time-consuming. Note Configuring BitLocker with an additional factor of authentication provides even more protection against TPM hardware attacks. BitLocker Network Unlock enables easier management for BitLocker-enabled clients and servers that use the TPM+PIN protection method in a domain environment. When a computer that is connected to a wired corporate network is rebooted, Network Unlock allows the PIN entry prompt to be bypassed. It automatically unlocks BitLocker-protected operating system volumes by using a trusted key that is provided by the Windows Deployment Services server as its secondary authentication method. To use Network Unlock, a PIN must be configured for the computer. When the computer isn't connected to the network, a PIN will need to be provided to unlock it. BitLocker Network Unlock has software and hardware requirements for both client computers, Windows Deployment services, and domain controllers that must be met before it can be used. Network Unlock uses two protectors - the TPM protector and the protector provided by the network or by the PIN. Automatic unlock uses a single protector - the one stored in the TPM. If the computer is joined to a network without the key protector, it will prompt to enter a PIN. If the PIN isn't available, the recovery key will need to be used to unlock the computer if it can't be connected to the network. For more info, seeBitLocker: How to enable Network Unlock. Yes, Encrypting File System (EFS) can be used to encrypt files on a BitLocker-protected drive. BitLocker helps protect the entire operating system drive against offline attacks, whereas EFS can provide additional user-based file level encryption for security separation between multiple users of the same computer. EFS can also be used in Windows to encrypt files on other drives that aren't encrypted by BitLocker. The root secrets of EFS are stored by default on the operating system drive; therefore, if BitLocker is enabled for the operating system drive, data that is encrypted by EFS on other drives is also indirectly protected by BitLocker. Yes. However, the debugger should be turned on before enabling BitLocker. Turning on the debugger ensures that the correct measurements are calculated when sealing to the TPM, allowing the computer to start properly. If debugging needs to be turned on or off when using BitLocker, be sure to suspend BitLocker first to avoid putting the computer into recovery mode. BitLocker has a storage driver stack that ensures memory dumps are encrypted when BitLocker is enabled. BitLocker doesn't support smart cards for pre-boot authentication. There's no single industry standard for smart card support in the firmware, and most computers either don't implement firmware support for smart cards, or only support specific smart cards and readers. This lack of standardization makes supporting them difficult. Microsoft doesn't support non-Microsoft TPM drivers and strongly recommends against using them with BitLocker. Attempting to use a non-Microsoft TPM driver with BitLocker may cause BitLocker to report that a TPM isn't present on the computer and not allow the TPM to be used with BitLocker. We don't recommend modifying the master boot record on computers whose operating system drives are BitLocker-protected for several security, reliability, and product support reasons. Changes to the master boot record (MBR) could change the security environment and prevent the computer from starting normally and complicate any efforts to recover from a corrupted MBR. Changes made to the MBR by anything other than Windows might force the computer into recovery mode or prevent it from booting entirely. The system check is designed to ensure the computer's BIOS or UEFI firmware is compatible with BitLocker and that the TPM is working correctly. The system check can fail for several reasons: Some computers can't read USB flash drives in the pre-boot environment. First, check the BIOS or UEFI firmware and boot settings to ensure that the use of USB drives is enabled. If it isn't enabled, enable the use of USB drives in the BIOS or UEFI firmware and boot settings, and then try to read the recovery key from the USB flash drive again. If the USB flash drive still can't be read, the hard drive will need to be mounted as a data drive on another computer so that there's an operating system to attempt to read the recovery key from the USB flash drive. If the USB flash drive has been corrupted or damaged, a recovery password may need to be supplied or use the recovery information that was backed up to AD DS. Also, if the recovery key is being used in the pre-boot environment, ensure that the drive is formatted by using the NTFS, FAT16, or FAT32 file system. TheSave to USBoption isn't shown by default for removable drives. If the option is unavailable, it means that a system administrator has disallowed the use of recovery keys. Automatic unlocking for fixed data drives requires the operating system drive to also be protected by BitLocker. If a computer is being used that doesn't have a BitLocker-protected operating system drive, then the fixed drive can't be automatically unlocked. For removable data drives, automatic unlocking can be added by right-clicking the drive in Windows Explorer and selectingManage BitLocker. Password or smart card credentials that were supplied when BitLocker was turned on can still be used to unlock the removable drive on other computers. Limited BitLocker functionality is available in Safe Mode. BitLocker-protected drives can be unlocked and decrypted by using theBitLocker Drive EncryptionControl Panel item. Right-clicking to access BitLocker options from Windows Explorer isn't available in Safe Mode. Both fixed and removable data drives can be locked by using the Manage-bde command-line tool and the -lock command. Note Ensure all data is saved to the drive before locking it. Once locked, the drive will become inaccessible. The syntax of this command is: Outside of using this command, data drives will be locked on shutdown and restart of the operating system. A removable data drive will also be locked automatically when the drive is removed from the computer. Yes. However, shadow copies made prior to enabling BitLocker will be automatically deleted when BitLocker is enabled on software-encrypted drives. If a hardware encrypted drive is being used, the shadow copies are retained. BitLocker should work like any specific physical machine within its hardware limitations as long as the environment (physical or virtual) meets Windows Operating System requirements to run. BitLocker is also supported on data volume VHDs, such as those used by clusters. Yes, BitLocker can be used with virtual machines (VMs) if the environment meets BitLocker's hardware and software requirements.

Applies to:Windows Server 2012 R2Original KB number:302873 Important This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, seeHow to back up and restore the registry in Windows. The GUID Partition Table disk architecture was introduced as part of the Extensible Firmware Interface initiative. GUID Partition Table is a new disk architecture that expands on the older Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning scheme that has been common to Intel-based computers. A partition is a contiguous space of storage on a physical or logical disk that functions as though it were a physically separate disk. Partitions are visible to the system firmware and the installed operating systems. Access to a partition is controlled by the system firmware and the operating system that is currently active. GUID Partition Table disks can grow to a large size. As of July 2001, the Microsoft implementation supports a hard disk of up to 18 EB (512 KB LBAs). The number of partitions on a GUID Partition Table disk is not constrained by temporary schemes such as container partitions as defined by the MBR Extended Boot Record. The Microsoft implementation of GUID Partition Table is limited to 128 partitions. However, it is important to note that one partition is used for the EFI System Partition, one for the Microsoft Reserved and two more are used if you use dynamic disks. This leaves 124 partitions for data use. The GUID Partition Table disk partition format is well defined and fully self-identifying. Data that is critical to the operating system is located in partitions and not in unpartitioned orhiddensectors. GUID Partition Table does not allow for hidden sectors or partitions. GUID Partition Table disks use primary and backup partition tables for redundancy and CRC32 fields for improved partition data structure integrity. The GUID Partition Table partition format uses version number and size fields for future expansion. Each GUID Partition Table partition has a unique identification GUID and a partition content type, so no coordination is necessary to prevent partition identifier collision. Each GUID Partition Table partition has a 36-character Unicode name, which means that any software can present an easily readable name for the partition without any additional understanding of the partition. MBR disks support only four primary partitions table entries or multiple logical partitions in the extended partition. If more partitions are wanted, a secondary structure, an extended partition, is necessary. Extended partitions are then subdivided into one or more logical disks. Only one extended partition can be present on any given drive, and the maximum number of logical drives is MAXULONG/4. All MBR disk partitions and logical drives must be cylinder-aligned, even on hardware RAID sets that are built from multiple different drives with no clear underlying physical geometry. MBR partitioning rules are complex and poorly specified. For example, does cylinder alignment mean that each partition must be at least one cylinder in length? An MBR partition is identified by a two-byte field, and coordination is necessary to avoid collision. IBM originally provided that coordination, but as of July 2001, there is no single authoritative list of partition identifiers. Another common practice is to use partitioned or ""hidden"" sectors to hold specific information. That practice is undocumented and results in severe system problems that are difficult to debug. Over the years, broken implementations and tools have been released to the public, making support difficult. Chapter 16 of the Extensible Firmware Interface specification defines the GUID Partition Table format. This document is available at the following Intel Web site: The Unified EFI Specification Defines an Interface Between an Operating System and Platform Firmware Third-party information disclaimer The third-party products that this article discusses are manufactured by companies that are independent of Microsoft. Microsoft makes no warranty, implied or otherwise, about the performance or reliability of these products. No. GUID Partition Table disks are self-identifying. All the information that is needed to interpret the partitioning scheme of a GUID Partition Table disk is completely contained in structures in specified locations on the physical media. In theory, a GUID Partition Table disk can be up to 264 sectors in a single logical block in length. Logical blocks are commonly 512 bytes or one sector in size. In practice, Windows XP supports GUID Partition Table disks of up to approximately 18 exabytes in size. In theory, an unlimited number. As the July 2001, the Microsoft implementation is 128 partitions. The number of partitions is limited by the amount of space that is reserved for making partition entries. No. However, all GUID Partition Table disks contain a protective MBR that is used for legacy programs that do not understand the GUID Partition Table disk structure. The Protective MBR, beginning in sector 0, precedes the GUID Partition Table partition table on the disk. The MBR contains one type 0xEE partition that spans the entire length of the disk. This is the same regardless of the number of partitions that are defined in the GUID Partition Table disk entry array. The Protective MBR protects GUID Partition Table disks from previously-released MBR disk tools such as Microsoft MS-DOS FDISK or Microsoft Windows NT Disk Administrator. These tools are not aware of GUID Partition Table and do not know how to properly access a GUID Partition Table disk. Legacy software that does not know about GUID Partition Table interprets only the Protected MBR when it accesses a GUID Partition Table disk. These tools will view a GUID Partition Table disk as having a single encompassing (possibly unrecognized) partition by interpreting the Protected MBR, rather than mistaking the disk for one that is unpartitioned. If this occurred, you must have used an MBR-only-aware disk tool to access the GUID Partition Table disk. The EE partition in the Protective MBR is specified to be the maximum size that is allowable in an MBR. Can the 64-bit version of Windows XP read, write, and boot from GUID Partition Table disks? The 64-bit version of Windows XP can read and write GUID Partition Table disks, but cannot boot from GUID Partition Table disks. Can the 64-bit version of Windows XP read, write, and boot from MBR disks? Yes. Can the 32-bit version of Windows XP read, write, and boot from GUID Partition Table disks? No. The 32-bit version will see only the Protective MBR. The EE partition will not be mounted or otherwise exposed to program software. Can the 32-bit version of Windows XP read, write, and boot from MBR disks? Yes. Can Microsoft Windows 2000, Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, or Microsoft Windows 98/95 read, write, and boot from GUID Partition Table? No. Legacy software will see only the Protective MBR. GUID Partition Table and MBR disks can be mixed only on 64-bit systems, and the following restrictions apply: The Windows XP loader and the boot partition must reside on a GUID Partition Table disk. Other hard disks can be either MBR or GUID Partition Table. Both MBR and GUID Partition Table disks can be present in a single dynamic disk group. Volume sets can span both MBR and GUID Partition Table disks, however, the MBR cylinder alignment restriction might cause some difficulties with mirroring or striping MBR and GUID Partition Table disks. Removable media must be MBR orsuperfloppy. Removable media without either GUID Partition Table or MBR formatting is considered a superfloppy. The entire media is treated as a single partition. The media manufacturer performs any MBR partitioning of removable media; Windows never partitions removable media. If the media does have an MBR, only one partition is supported. There is little user-discernible difference between MBR-partitioned media and superfloppies. Examples of removable media include floppy disks, JAZZ disk cartridges, magneto-optical media, DVD-ROM, and CD-ROM. Hard disk drives on external buses such as SCSI or IEEE 1394 are not considered removable. What is the default behavior of the 64-bit version of Windows XP when partitioning media? Fixed disks are partitioned by using GUID Partition Table partitioning. GUID Partition Table disks can be converted to MBR disks only if all existing partitioning is first deleted, with associated loss of data. What is the default behavior of the 32-bit version of Windows XP when partitioning media? Only MBR disks can be used. MBR disks cannot be converted to GUID Partition Table disks. How can a drive letter in the operating system be mapped to a partition in Extensible Firmware Interface Firmware? There is no inherent mapping between drive letter and partition that can be used to determine one from the other. A basic data partition must be identified by its partition GUID. How can an Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition be created? Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions can be created by using the Extensible Firmware Interface firmware utility Diskpart.efi or the Windows XP command-line utility Diskpart.exe, or they can be created programmatically by using IOCTL_SET_DRIVE_LAYOUT . You should not change any partition header entry directly. Do not use disk tools or utilities to make alterations or changes. Detachable disks are commonly expected to migrate between computers or simply to be unavailable to the operating system at times. Examples of detachable disks are IEEE 1394 disks, which can be easily disconnected by the end user, or Microsoft Cluster Services (MSCS) shared disks, which move between nodes in a cluster. Windows XP supports only MBR partitioning on detachable disks. What is the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition? The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition contains the NTLDR, Boot.ini, and other files that are necessary to boot the computer, such as drivers. The Partition GUID defines the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition: DEFINE_GUID (PARTITION_SYSTEM_GUID, 0xC12A7328L, 0xF81F, 0x11D2, 0xBA, 0x4B, 0x00, 0xA0, 0xC9, 0x3E, 0xC9, 0x3B) Do only GUID Partition Table disks have Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions? No, MBR disks can also have Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions. Extensible Firmware Interface specifies booting from either GUID Partition Table or MBR. The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions on an MBR disk is identified by partition type 0xEF. However, Windows XP does not support booting Extensible Firmware Interface from MBR disks or 0xEF partitions. How big is the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition? The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is determined by using the following algorithm: Max (100MB, min (1 percent of physical disk, 1GB)) In other words, the size of the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition must be the larger of these two numbers, 100 MB or 1 percent of the physical disk size (up to 1 GB). The physical disk size is measured at the time of disk partitioning. The value 1 percent of the physical disk is calculated at the time that the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is created and does not change if the disk is extended later (for example, by using RAID). Can there be two Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions on a single disk? Such a configuration should not be created and will not be supported. What about two Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions on two different disks? Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions can be replicated for high-availability configurations. Replication must be done manually and the contents must be synchronized manually. Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions cannot be mirrored. What does Microsoft place in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition? Microsoft places the loader, and other files that are necessary to boot the operating system in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. Where should the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition be placed on the disk? The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition must be first on the disk. While there is no architectural requirement, there are numerous reasons why it is beneficial to place the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition first. The primary reason for this is that it is impossible to span volumes when the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is logically between the two data partitions you are attempting to span. What should a computer or device manufacturer place in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition? The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition should only include files that are required for booting an operating system, platform tools that run before operating system boot, or files that must be accessed before operating system boot, for example in performing pre-boot system maintenance. Other value-added files or diagnostics that are used while the operating system is running should not be placed in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. It is important to note that the space in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is a limited system resource; its primary purpose is to provide storage for the files that are necessary to boot the operating system. The preferred option is for computer manufacturers to place value-added contents in an OEM-specific partition. Just like MBR OEM partitions, the contents of GUID Partition Table OEM (or other unrecognized) partitions are not exposed (given drive letters or returned in volume lists). Users are warned that deleting the partition can cause the computer to fail to operate. An OEM-specific partition should be placed before the Microsoft Reserved Partition and after any Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition on the disk. Although not architectural, this placement has the same benefits as placing the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition first. For example, it is also impossible to span volumes when an OEM-specific partition is logically between the two data partitions you are attempting to span. Placement in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is an option for programs or files that run in the pre-operating system boot environment. However, the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is architecturally-shared space and represents a limited resource. Consuming space in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition should be considered carefully. Files that are not relevant to the pre-operating system boot environment should not be placed in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. What is a Microsoft Reserved Partition? The Microsoft Reserved Partition reserves space on each disk drive for subsequent use by operating system software. GUID Partition Table disks do not allow hidden sectors. Software components that formerly used hidden sectors now allocate portions of the Microsoft Reserved Partition for component-specific partitions. For example, converting a basic disk to a dynamic disk causes the Microsoft Reserved Partition on that disk to be reduced in size and a newly created partition holds the dynamic disk database. The Microsoft Reserved Partition has the following Partition GUID: DEFINE_GUID (PARTITION_MSFT_RESERVED_GUID, 0xE3C9E316L, 0x0B5C, 0x4DB8, 0x81, 0x7D, 0xF9, 0x2D, 0xF0, 0x02, 0x15, 0xAE What disks require a Microsoft Reserved Partition? Every GUID Partition Table disk must contain a Microsoft Reserved Partition. The Microsoft Reserved Partition must be the first partition after the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition (if any) on the disk. It is particularly important that the Microsoft Reserved Partition be created before other primary data partitions. Who creates the Microsoft Reserved Partition? The Microsoft Reserved Partition must be created when disk-partitioning information is first written to the drive. If the manufacturer partitions the disk, the manufacturer must create the Microsoft Reserved Partition at the same time. If Windows partitions the disk during Setup, it creates the Microsoft Reserved Partition. Why must the Microsoft Reserved Partition be created when the disk is first partitioned? After the disk is partitioned, there will be no free space left to create a Microsoft Reserved Partition. How big is the Microsoft Reserved Partition? When initially created, the size of the Microsoft Reserved Partition depends on the size of the disk drive: Each bootable drive must contain an Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition, a Microsoft Reserved Partition, and at least one basic data partition that contains the operating system. Each data drive must contain at least a Microsoft Reserved Partition and one basic data partition. All basic data partitions on the drive should be contiguous. As previously noted, placing an OEM-specific or other unrecognized partition between data partitions imposes limitations on later volume spanning Basic data partitions correspond to primary MBR partitions 0x6 (FAT), 0x7 (NTFS), or 0xB (FAT32). There is a direct one-to-one correlation between a basic data partition and a drive letter or mount point, other volume device object, or both. Each basic data partition is represented in Windows as a volume device object, and optionally as a mount point or a drive letter. It has the following partition type GUID: DEFINE_GUID (PARTITION_BASIC_DATA_GUID, 0xEBD0A0A2L, 0xB9E5, 0x4433, 0x87, 0xC0, 0x68, 0xB6, 0xB7, 0x26, 0x99, 0xC7) The user won't see these partitions exposed in Windows Explorer, nor is any recognized file system exposed to legacy programs such as Context Indexing. The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition, OEM-specific, and other unrecognized partitions will be visible only in the Disk Management MMC snap-in. Windows XP exposes only basic data partitions. Other partitions with FAT file systems may be mounted, but not exposed (only programmatically). Only basic data partitions are assigned drive letters or mount points. The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition FAT file system is mounted, but not exposed. This allows programs running under Windows to update the contents of the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. The following registry key locates the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/System/Setup/SystemPartition The Microsoft Reserved Partition (and any partitions that are created from the Microsoft Reserved Partition) could have recognizable file systems; none are exposed. Any OEM-specific partitions or partitions that are associated with other operating systems are not recognized by Windows. Unrecognized partitions with recognizable file systems are treated like the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. They will be mounted, but not exposed. Unlike MBR disks, there is no practical difference between OEM-specific partitions and other operating system partitions; all are unrecognized. The user can use disk management tools such as the Disk Management MMC snap-in or Diskpart.exe. The Microsoft Reserved Partition and any partitions that are created from the Microsoft Reserved Partition are only visible from a command prompt. Dynamic disks use two different GUID Partition Table partitions: A data container partition corresponding to the MBR partition 0x42, with the following GUID:DEFINE_GUID (PARTITION_LDM_DATA_GUID, 0xAF9B60A0L, 0x1431, 0x4F62, 0xBC, 0x68, 0x33, 0x11, 0x71, 0x4A, 0x69, 0xAD) A partition to contain the dynamic configuration database, with the following GUID:DEFINE_GUID(PARTITION_LDM_METADATA_GUID, 0x5808C8AAL, 0x7E8F, 0x42E0, 0x85, 0xD2, 0xE1, 0xE9, 0x04, 0x34, 0xCF, 0xB3)
Volumes are created in the data container and are mounted by default. This is the same as the contents of 0x42 MBR partitions. For a drive to be eligible for conversion to dynamic, all basic data partitions on the drive must be contiguous. If other unrecognized partitions separate basic data partitions, the disk cannot be converted. This is one of the reasons that the Microsoft Reserved Partition must be created before any basic data partitions. The first step in conversion is to separate a portion of the Microsoft Reserved Partition to create the configuration database partition. All non-bootable basic partitions are then combined into a single data container partition. Boot partitions are retained as separate data container partitions. This is analogous to conversion of primary partitions. Windows XP differs from Windows 2000 in that basic and extended partitions are preferentially converted to a single 0x42 partition, rather than being retained as multiple distinct 0x42 partitions as on Windows 2000. You can access the GUID Partition Table disk partitions of different types by using the following tools. Diskpart.efi:Firmware: Extensible Firmware Interface System PartitionMicrosoft Reserved Partition Diskpart.exe:Windows XP: Extensible Firmware Interface System PartitionMicrosoft Reserved Partition Diskgmt.msc:Windows XP: Extensible Firmware Interface System PartitionDATA Explorer.exe:Windows XP: DATA You can also develop your own tools (by using the Microsoft Win32 or Microsoft Win64 APIs) to access the GUID Partition Table disk partitions at their primitive levels. GUID Partition Table and MBR disks are managed the same way. Disks can be formatted as GUID Partition Table or MBR by using the Diskpart.exe command-line utility or by using the Disk Management snap-in. Volumes can be created on both GUID Partition Table and MBR disks, and both kinds of disks can be mixed in the same dynamic disk group. There is no FTdisk set support on Windows XP for MBR or GUID Partition Table disks. The only support for logical volumes is through dynamic disks. Yes, but only if the disk contains no partitions or volumes. Any data on the disk will be destroyed. GUID Partition Table disks are only supported on the 64-bit version of Windows XP. NTFS is recommended on all basic data partitions and all dynamic volumes. Windows Setup and the Disk Management snap-in offer only NTFS. However, you can still use FAT16 and FAT32 on these partitions as well. To circumvent this, the partition or volume must be formatted explicitly by using the Format tool. No. The Disk and Partition GUIDs will no longer be unique. This must never happen. You can make a sector-by-sector copy of the contents of Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition or basic data partitions. Yes; however, there are some key caveats. The OEM Preinstallation Kit (OPK) initializes the Disk and Partition GUIDs to zero. On first boot of Windows XP, the operating system generates unique GUIDs. The OPK only supports generation of Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition, Microsoft Reserved Partition, and basic data partitions. If a program has recorded any Disk or Partition GUIDs, the program may not work. Any programs, drivers, utilities, or firmware implementations that are supplied by computer manufacturers or program vendors that rely on GUIDs should be capable of handling GUIDs that change from the OPK initialization values to those that are generated by the operating system. It is a way for OEMs to simplify operating system pre-installation and system recovery. This command can easily be extended to create a default disk configuration for the platform. For example, the computer manufacturer could extend the MAKE command to automatically partition the boot drive with an Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition, Microsoft Reserved Partition, an OEM-specific partition, and one basic data partition. For example, consider a possible disk configuration called BOOT_DISK. In the event of disaster recovery, MAKE BOOT_DISK would allow the customer to completely repartition a boot disk to the original factory defaults. Windows XP will generate new GUIDs for any duplicate Disk GUID, Microsoft Reserved Partition GUID, or Microsoft Reserved Partition basic data GUID upon detection. This is similar to the duplicate MBR signature handling in Windows 2000. Duplicate GUIDs on a dynamic container or database partition cause unpredictable results. This depends on the cluster size that is selected at the time of formatting. NTFS is currently limited to 2^32-1 allocation units. This yields a 256TB volume, using 64k clusters. However, this has only been tested to 16TB, or 17,592,186,040,320 bytes, using 4K cluster size. The following chart shows the NTFS limits based on cluster size: For example, to format a volume that has a cluster size of 8 KB, you would use a command such as the following from a command prompt, where/a: ####specifies the number of bytes per cluster: If you choose a cluster size that is too small for the size of the partition, you receive the following error message when you try to format the partition: The format operation did not complete because the cluster count is higher than expected To determine the cluster size of a volume, run the following command at a command prompt, and then note theBytes Per Clustervalue: Note The <volume> placeholder represents the volume letter. For example, when you run thefsutil fsinfo ntfsinfo c:command, you may receive results that resemble the following output: NTFS Volume Serial Number : 0xf4300f6c300f3560Version : 3.1Number Sectors : 0x000000001d17dbeeTotal Clusters : 0x0000000003a2fb7dFree Clusters : 0x000000000102bfa0Total Reserved : 0x0000000000000800Bytes Per Sector : 512Bytes Per Cluster : 4096Bytes Per FileRecord Segment : 1024Clusters Per FileRecord Segment : 0Mft Valid Data Length : 0x000000000e630000Mft Start Lcn : 0x00000000000c0000Mft2 Start Lcn : 0x0000000001d17dbeMft Zone Start : 0x00000000002185a0Mft Zone End : 0x0000000000218740RM Identifier : 1587CC47-A713-11DB-9287-806E6F6E6963 Note In this example, theBytes Per Clustervalue is 4096. This value represents a 4-kilobyte (KB) cluster size.

For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, seeHow to back up and restore the registry in Windows. The GUID Partition Table disk architecture was introduced as part of the Extensible Firmware Interface initiative. GUID Partition Table is a new disk architecture that expands on the older Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning scheme that has been common to Intel-based computers. A partition is a contiguous space of storage on a physical or logical disk that functions as though it were a physically separate disk. Partitions are visible to the system firmware and the installed operating systems. Access to a partition is controlled by the system firmware and the operating system that is currently active. GUID Partition Table disks can grow to a large size. As of July 2001, the Microsoft implementation supports a hard disk of up to 18 EB (512 KB LBAs). The number of partitions on a GUID Partition Table disk is not constrained by temporary schemes such as container partitions as defined by the MBR Extended Boot Record. The Microsoft implementation of GUID Partition Table is limited to 128 partitions. However, it is important to note that one partition is used for the EFI System Partition, one for the Microsoft Reserved and two more are used if you use dynamic disks. This leaves 124 partitions for data use. The GUID Partition Table disk partition format is well defined and fully self-identifying. Data that is critical to the operating system is located in partitions and not in unpartitioned orhiddensectors. GUID Partition Table does not allow for hidden sectors or partitions. GUID Partition Table disks use primary and backup partition tables for redundancy and CRC32 fields for improved partition data structure integrity. The GUID Partition Table partition format uses version number and size fields for future expansion. Each GUID Partition Table partition has a unique identification GUID and a partition content type, so no coordination is necessary to prevent partition identifier collision. Each GUID Partition Table partition has a 36-character Unicode name, which means that any software can present an easily readable name for the partition without any additional understanding of the partition. MBR disks support only four primary partitions table entries or multiple logical partitions in the extended partition. If more partitions are wanted, a secondary structure, an extended partition, is necessary. Extended partitions are then subdivided into one or more logical disks. Only one extended partition can be present on any given drive, and the maximum number of logical drives is MAXULONG/4. All MBR disk partitions and logical drives must be cylinder-aligned, even on hardware RAID sets that are built from multiple different drives with no clear underlying physical geometry. MBR partitioning rules are complex and poorly specified. For example, does cylinder alignment mean that each partition must be at least one cylinder in length? An MBR partition is identified by a two-byte field, and coordination is necessary to avoid collision. IBM originally provided that coordination, but as of July 2001, there is no single authoritative list of partition identifiers. Another common practice is to use partitioned or ""hidden"" sectors to hold specific information. That practice is undocumented and results in severe system problems that are difficult to debug. Over the years, broken implementations and tools have been released to the public, making support difficult. Chapter 16 of the Extensible Firmware Interface specification defines the GUID Partition Table format. This document is available at the following Intel Web site: The Unified EFI Specification Defines an Interface Between an Operating System and Platform Firmware Third-party information disclaimer The third-party products that this article discusses are manufactured by companies that are independent of Microsoft. Microsoft makes no warranty, implied or otherwise, about the performance or reliability of these products. No. GUID Partition Table disks are self-identifying. All the information that is needed to interpret the partitioning scheme of a GUID Partition Table disk is completely contained in structures in specified locations on the physical media. In theory, a GUID Partition Table disk can be up to 264 sectors in a single logical block in length. Logical blocks are commonly 512 bytes or one sector in size. In practice, Windows XP supports GUID Partition Table disks of up to approximately 18 exabytes in size. In theory, an unlimited number. As the July 2001, the Microsoft implementation is 128 partitions. The number of partitions is limited by the amount of space that is reserved for making partition entries. No. However, all GUID Partition Table disks contain a protective MBR that is used for legacy programs that do not understand the GUID Partition Table disk structure. The Protective MBR, beginning in sector 0, precedes the GUID Partition Table partition table on the disk. The MBR contains one type 0xEE partition that spans the entire length of the disk. This is the same regardless of the number of partitions that are defined in the GUID Partition Table disk entry array. The Protective MBR protects GUID Partition Table disks from previously-released MBR disk tools such as Microsoft MS-DOS FDISK or Microsoft Windows NT Disk Administrator. These tools are not aware of GUID Partition Table and do not know how to properly access a GUID Partition Table disk. Legacy software that does not know about GUID Partition Table interprets only the Protected MBR when it accesses a GUID Partition Table disk. These tools will view a GUID Partition Table disk as having a single encompassing (possibly unrecognized) partition by interpreting the Protected MBR, rather than mistaking the disk for one that is unpartitioned. If this occurred, you must have used an MBR-only-aware disk tool to access the GUID Partition Table disk. The EE partition in the Protective MBR is specified to be the maximum size that is allowable in an MBR. Can the 64-bit version of Windows XP read, write, and boot from GUID Partition Table disks? The 64-bit version of Windows XP can read and write GUID Partition Table disks, but cannot boot from GUID Partition Table disks. Can the 64-bit version of Windows XP read, write, and boot from MBR disks? Yes. Can the 32-bit version of Windows XP read, write, and boot from GUID Partition Table disks? No. The 32-bit version will see only the Protective MBR. The EE partition will not be mounted or otherwise exposed to program software. Can the 32-bit version of Windows XP read, write, and boot from MBR disks? Yes. Can Microsoft Windows 2000, Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, or Microsoft Windows 98/95 read, write, and boot from GUID Partition Table? No. Legacy software will see only the Protective MBR. GUID Partition Table and MBR disks can be mixed only on 64-bit systems, and the following restrictions apply: The Windows XP loader and the boot partition must reside on a GUID Partition Table disk. Other hard disks can be either MBR or GUID Partition Table. Both MBR and GUID Partition Table disks can be present in a single dynamic disk group. Volume sets can span both MBR and GUID Partition Table disks, however, the MBR cylinder alignment restriction might cause some difficulties with mirroring or striping MBR and GUID Partition Table disks. Removable media must be MBR orsuperfloppy. Removable media without either GUID Partition Table or MBR formatting is considered a superfloppy. The entire media is treated as a single partition. The media manufacturer performs any MBR partitioning of removable media; Windows never partitions removable media. If the media does have an MBR, only one partition is supported. There is little user-discernible difference between MBR-partitioned media and superfloppies. Examples of removable media include floppy disks, JAZZ disk cartridges, magneto-optical media, DVD-ROM, and CD-ROM. Hard disk drives on external buses such as SCSI or IEEE 1394 are not considered removable. What is the default behavior of the 64-bit version of Windows XP when partitioning media? Fixed disks are partitioned by using GUID Partition Table partitioning. GUID Partition Table disks can be converted to MBR disks only if all existing partitioning is first deleted, with associated loss of data. What is the default behavior of the 32-bit version of Windows XP when partitioning media? Only MBR disks can be used. MBR disks cannot be converted to GUID Partition Table disks. How can a drive letter in the operating system be mapped to a partition in Extensible Firmware Interface Firmware? There is no inherent mapping between drive letter and partition that can be used to determine one from the other. A basic data partition must be identified by its partition GUID. How can an Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition be created? Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions can be created by using the Extensible Firmware Interface firmware utility Diskpart.efi or the Windows XP command-line utility Diskpart.exe, or they can be created programmatically by using IOCTL_SET_DRIVE_LAYOUT . You should not change any partition header entry directly. Do not use disk tools or utilities to make alterations or changes. Detachable disks are commonly expected to migrate between computers or simply to be unavailable to the operating system at times. Examples of detachable disks are IEEE 1394 disks, which can be easily disconnected by the end user, or Microsoft Cluster Services (MSCS) shared disks, which move between nodes in a cluster. Windows XP supports only MBR partitioning on detachable disks. What is the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition? The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition contains the NTLDR, Boot.ini, and other files that are necessary to boot the computer, such as drivers. The Partition GUID defines the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition: DEFINE_GUID (PARTITION_SYSTEM_GUID, 0xC12A7328L, 0xF81F, 0x11D2, 0xBA, 0x4B, 0x00, 0xA0, 0xC9, 0x3E, 0xC9, 0x3B) Do only GUID Partition Table disks have Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions? No, MBR disks can also have Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions. Extensible Firmware Interface specifies booting from either GUID Partition Table or MBR. The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions on an MBR disk is identified by partition type 0xEF. However, Windows XP does not support booting Extensible Firmware Interface from MBR disks or 0xEF partitions. How big is the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition? The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is determined by using the following algorithm: Max (100MB, min (1 percent of physical disk, 1GB)) In other words, the size of the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition must be the larger of these two numbers, 100 MB or 1 percent of the physical disk size (up to 1 GB). The physical disk size is measured at the time of disk partitioning. The value 1 percent of the physical disk is calculated at the time that the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is created and does not change if the disk is extended later (for example, by using RAID). Can there be two Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions on a single disk? Such a configuration should not be created and will not be supported. What about two Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions on two different disks? Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions can be replicated for high-availability configurations. Replication must be done manually and the contents must be synchronized manually. Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions cannot be mirrored. What does Microsoft place in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition? Microsoft places the loader, and other files that are necessary to boot the operating system in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. Where should the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition be placed on the disk? The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition must be first on the disk. While there is no architectural requirement, there are numerous reasons why it is beneficial to place the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition first. The primary reason for this is that it is impossible to span volumes when the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is logically between the two data partitions you are attempting to span. What should a computer or device manufacturer place in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition? The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition should only include files that are required for booting an operating system, platform tools that run before operating system boot, or files that must be accessed before operating system boot, for example in performing pre-boot system maintenance. Other value-added files or diagnostics that are used while the operating system is running should not be placed in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. It is important to note that the space in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is a limited system resource; its primary purpose is to provide storage for the files that are necessary to boot the operating system. The preferred option is for computer manufacturers to place value-added contents in an OEM-specific partition. Just like MBR OEM partitions, the contents of GUID Partition Table OEM (or other unrecognized) partitions are not exposed (given drive letters or returned in volume lists). Users are warned that deleting the partition can cause the computer to fail to operate. An OEM-specific partition should be placed before the Microsoft Reserved Partition and after any Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition on the disk. Although not architectural, this placement has the same benefits as placing the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition first. For example, it is also impossible to span volumes when an OEM-specific partition is logically between the two data partitions you are attempting to span. Placement in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is an option for programs or files that run in the pre-operating system boot environment. However, the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is architecturally-shared space and represents a limited resource. Consuming space in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition should be considered carefully. Files that are not relevant to the pre-operating system boot environment should not be placed in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. What is a Microsoft Reserved Partition? The Microsoft Reserved Partition reserves space on each disk drive for subsequent use by operating system software. GUID Partition Table disks do not allow hidden sectors. Software components that formerly used hidden sectors now allocate portions of the Microsoft Reserved Partition for component-specific partitions. For example, converting a basic disk to a dynamic disk causes the Microsoft Reserved Partition on that disk to be reduced in size and a newly created partition holds the dynamic disk database. The Microsoft Reserved Partition has the following Partition GUID: DEFINE_GUID (PARTITION_MSFT_RESERVED_GUID, 0xE3C9E316L, 0x0B5C, 0x4DB8, 0x81, 0x7D, 0xF9, 0x2D, 0xF0, 0x02, 0x15, 0xAE What disks require a Microsoft Reserved Partition? Every GUID Partition Table disk must contain a Microsoft Reserved Partition. The Microsoft Reserved Partition must be the first partition after the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition (if any) on the disk. It is particularly important that the Microsoft Reserved Partition be created before other primary data partitions. Who creates the Microsoft Reserved Partition? The Microsoft Reserved Partition must be created when disk-partitioning information is first written to the drive. If the manufacturer partitions the disk, the manufacturer must create the Microsoft Reserved Partition at the same time. If Windows partitions the disk during Setup, it creates the Microsoft Reserved Partition. Why must the Microsoft Reserved Partition be created when the disk is first partitioned? After the disk is partitioned, there will be no free space left to create a Microsoft Reserved Partition. How big is the Microsoft Reserved Partition? When initially created, the size of the Microsoft Reserved Partition depends on the size of the disk drive: Each bootable drive must contain an Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition, a Microsoft Reserved Partition, and at least one basic data partition that contains the operating system. Each data drive must contain at least a Microsoft Reserved Partition and one basic data partition. All basic data partitions on the drive should be contiguous. As previously noted, placing an OEM-specific or other unrecognized partition between data partitions imposes limitations on later volume spanning Basic data partitions correspond to primary MBR partitions 0x6 (FAT), 0x7 (NTFS), or 0xB (FAT32). There is a direct one-to-one correlation between a basic data partition and a drive letter or mount point, other volume device object, or both. Each basic data partition is represented in Windows as a volume device object, and optionally as a mount point or a drive letter. It has the following partition type GUID: DEFINE_GUID (PARTITION_BASIC_DATA_GUID, 0xEBD0A0A2L, 0xB9E5, 0x4433, 0x87, 0xC0, 0x68, 0xB6, 0xB7, 0x26, 0x99, 0xC7) The user won't see these partitions exposed in Windows Explorer, nor is any recognized file system exposed to legacy programs such as Context Indexing. The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition, OEM-specific, and other unrecognized partitions will be visible only in the Disk Management MMC snap-in. Windows XP exposes only basic data partitions. Other partitions with FAT file systems may be mounted, but not exposed (only programmatically). Only basic data partitions are assigned drive letters or mount points. The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition FAT file system is mounted, but not exposed. This allows programs running under Windows to update the contents of the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. The following registry key locates the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/System/Setup/SystemPartition The Microsoft Reserved Partition (and any partitions that are created from the Microsoft Reserved Partition) could have recognizable file systems; none are exposed. Any OEM-specific partitions or partitions that are associated with other operating systems are not recognized by Windows. Unrecognized partitions with recognizable file systems are treated like the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. They will be mounted, but not exposed. Unlike MBR disks, there is no practical difference between OEM-specific partitions and other operating system partitions; all are unrecognized. The user can use disk management tools such as the Disk Management MMC snap-in or Diskpart.exe. The Microsoft Reserved Partition and any partitions that are created from the Microsoft Reserved Partition are only visible from a command prompt. Dynamic disks use two different GUID Partition Table partitions: A data container partition corresponding to the MBR partition 0x42, with the following GUID:DEFINE_GUID (PARTITION_LDM_DATA_GUID, 0xAF9B60A0L, 0x1431, 0x4F62, 0xBC, 0x68, 0x33, 0x11, 0x71, 0x4A, 0x69, 0xAD) A partition to contain the dynamic configuration database, with the following GUID:DEFINE_GUID(PARTITION_LDM_METADATA_GUID, 0x5808C8AAL, 0x7E8F, 0x42E0, 0x85, 0xD2, 0xE1, 0xE9, 0x04, 0x34, 0xCF, 0xB3)
Volumes are created in the data container and are mounted by default. This is the same as the contents of 0x42 MBR partitions. For a drive to be eligible for conversion to dynamic, all basic data partitions on the drive must be contiguous. If other unrecognized partitions separate basic data partitions, the disk cannot be converted. This is one of the reasons that the Microsoft Reserved Partition must be created before any basic data partitions. The first step in conversion is to separate a portion of the Microsoft Reserved Partition to create the configuration database partition. All non-bootable basic partitions are then combined into a single data container partition. Boot partitions are retained as separate data container partitions. This is analogous to conversion of primary partitions. Windows XP differs from Windows 2000 in that basic and extended partitions are preferentially converted to a single 0x42 partition, rather than being retained as multiple distinct 0x42 partitions as on Windows 2000. You can access the GUID Partition Table disk partitions of different types by using the following tools. Diskpart.efi:Firmware: Extensible Firmware Interface System PartitionMicrosoft Reserved Partition Diskpart.exe:Windows XP: Extensible Firmware Interface System PartitionMicrosoft Reserved Partition Diskgmt.msc:Windows XP: Extensible Firmware Interface System PartitionDATA Explorer.exe:Windows XP: DATA You can also develop your own tools (by using the Microsoft Win32 or Microsoft Win64 APIs) to access the GUID Partition Table disk partitions at their primitive levels. GUID Partition Table and MBR disks are managed the same way. Disks can be formatted as GUID Partition Table or MBR by using the Diskpart.exe command-line utility or by using the Disk Management snap-in. Volumes can be created on both GUID Partition Table and MBR disks, and both kinds of disks can be mixed in the same dynamic disk group. There is no FTdisk set support on Windows XP for MBR or GUID Partition Table disks. The only support for logical volumes is through dynamic disks. Yes, but only if the disk contains no partitions or volumes. Any data on the disk will be destroyed. GUID Partition Table disks are only supported on the 64-bit version of Windows XP. NTFS is recommended on all basic data partitions and all dynamic volumes. Windows Setup and the Disk Management snap-in offer only NTFS. However, you can still use FAT16 and FAT32 on these partitions as well. To circumvent this, the partition or volume must be formatted explicitly by using the Format tool. No. The Disk and Partition GUIDs will no longer be unique. This must never happen. You can make a sector-by-sector copy of the contents of Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition or basic data partitions. Yes; however, there are some key caveats. The OEM Preinstallation Kit (OPK) initializes the Disk and Partition GUIDs to zero. On first boot of Windows XP, the operating system generates unique GUIDs. The OPK only supports generation of Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition, Microsoft Reserved Partition, and basic data partitions. If a program has recorded any Disk or Partition GUIDs, the program may not work. Any programs, drivers, utilities, or firmware implementations that are supplied by computer manufacturers or program vendors that rely on GUIDs should be capable of handling GUIDs that change from the OPK initialization values to those that are generated by the operating system. It is a way for OEMs to simplify operating system pre-installation and system recovery. This command can easily be extended to create a default disk configuration for the platform. For example, the computer manufacturer could extend the MAKE command to automatically partition the boot drive with an Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition, Microsoft Reserved Partition, an OEM-specific partition, and one basic data partition. For example, consider a possible disk configuration called BOOT_DISK. In the event of disaster recovery, MAKE BOOT_DISK would allow the customer to completely repartition a boot disk to the original factory defaults. Windows XP will generate new GUIDs for any duplicate Disk GUID, Microsoft Reserved Partition GUID, or Microsoft Reserved Partition basic data GUID upon detection. This is similar to the duplicate MBR signature handling in Windows 2000. Duplicate GUIDs on a dynamic container or database partition cause unpredictable results. This depends on the cluster size that is selected at the time of formatting. NTFS is currently limited to 2^32-1 allocation units. This yields a 256TB volume, using 64k clusters. However, this has only been tested to 16TB, or 17,592,186,040,320 bytes, using 4K cluster size. The following chart shows the NTFS limits based on cluster size: For example, to format a volume that has a cluster size of 8 KB, you would use a command such as the following from a command prompt, where/a: ####specifies the number of bytes per cluster: If you choose a cluster size that is too small for the size of the partition, you receive the following error message when you try to format the partition: The format operation did not complete because the cluster count is higher than expected To determine the cluster size of a volume, run the following command at a command prompt, and then note theBytes Per Clustervalue: Note The <volume> placeholder represents the volume letter. For example, when you run thefsutil fsinfo ntfsinfo c:command, you may receive results that resemble the following output: NTFS Volume Serial Number : 0xf4300f6c300f3560Version : 3.1Number Sectors : 0x000000001d17dbeeTotal Clusters : 0x0000000003a2fb7dFree Clusters : 0x000000000102bfa0Total Reserved : 0x0000000000000800Bytes Per Sector : 512Bytes Per Cluster : 4096Bytes Per FileRecord Segment : 1024Clusters Per FileRecord Segment : 0Mft Valid Data Length : 0x000000000e630000Mft Start Lcn : 0x00000000000c0000Mft2 Start Lcn : 0x0000000001d17dbeMft Zone Start : 0x00000000002185a0Mft Zone End : 0x0000000000218740RM Identifier : 1587CC47-A713-11DB-9287-806E6F6E6963 Note In this example, theBytes Per Clustervalue is 4096. This value represents a 4-kilobyte (KB) cluster size.

What is the dependency on 32-bit vs. 64-bit UEFI?,"Microsoft does support both 32 and 64 bit UEFI. The bitness of the OS and the UEFI firmware must match. (for example, if you have a 64-bit UEFI firmware then you must install 64-bit Windows OS).","This article provides a list of frequently asked questions about the GUID Partition Table disk architecture. Applies to:Windows Server 2012 R2Original KB number:302873 Important This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, seeHow to back up and restore the registry in Windows. The GUID Partition Table disk architecture was introduced as part of the Extensible Firmware Interface initiative. GUID Partition Table is a new disk architecture that expands on the older Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning scheme that has been common to Intel-based computers. A partition is a contiguous space of storage on a physical or logical disk that functions as though it were a physically separate disk. Partitions are visible to the system firmware and the installed operating systems. Access to a partition is controlled by the system firmware and the operating system that is currently active. GUID Partition Table disks can grow to a large size. As of July 2001, the Microsoft implementation supports a hard disk of up to 18 EB (512 KB LBAs). The number of partitions on a GUID Partition Table disk is not constrained by temporary schemes such as container partitions as defined by the MBR Extended Boot Record. The Microsoft implementation of GUID Partition Table is limited to 128 partitions. However, it is important to note that one partition is used for the EFI System Partition, one for the Microsoft Reserved and two more are used if you use dynamic disks. This leaves 124 partitions for data use. The GUID Partition Table disk partition format is well defined and fully self-identifying. Data that is critical to the operating system is located in partitions and not in unpartitioned orhiddensectors. GUID Partition Table does not allow for hidden sectors or partitions. GUID Partition Table disks use primary and backup partition tables for redundancy and CRC32 fields for improved partition data structure integrity. The GUID Partition Table partition format uses version number and size fields for future expansion. Each GUID Partition Table partition has a unique identification GUID and a partition content type, so no coordination is necessary to prevent partition identifier collision. Each GUID Partition Table partition has a 36-character Unicode name, which means that any software can present an easily readable name for the partition without any additional understanding of the partition. MBR disks support only four primary partitions table entries or multiple logical partitions in the extended partition. If more partitions are wanted, a secondary structure, an extended partition, is necessary. Extended partitions are then subdivided into one or more logical disks. Only one extended partition can be present on any given drive, and the maximum number of logical drives is MAXULONG/4. All MBR disk partitions and logical drives must be cylinder-aligned, even on hardware RAID sets that are built from multiple different drives with no clear underlying physical geometry. MBR partitioning rules are complex and poorly specified. For example, does cylinder alignment mean that each partition must be at least one cylinder in length? An MBR partition is identified by a two-byte field, and coordination is necessary to avoid collision. IBM originally provided that coordination, but as of July 2001, there is no single authoritative list of partition identifiers. Another common practice is to use partitioned or ""hidden"" sectors to hold specific information. That practice is undocumented and results in severe system problems that are difficult to debug. Over the years, broken implementations and tools have been released to the public, making support difficult. Chapter 16 of the Extensible Firmware Interface specification defines the GUID Partition Table format. This document is available at the following Intel Web site: The Unified EFI Specification Defines an Interface Between an Operating System and Platform Firmware Third-party information disclaimer The third-party products that this article discusses are manufactured by companies that are independent of Microsoft. Microsoft makes no warranty, implied or otherwise, about the performance or reliability of these products. No. GUID Partition Table disks are self-identifying. All the information that is needed to interpret the partitioning scheme of a GUID Partition Table disk is completely contained in structures in specified locations on the physical media. In theory, a GUID Partition Table disk can be up to 264 sectors in a single logical block in length. Logical blocks are commonly 512 bytes or one sector in size. In practice, Windows XP supports GUID Partition Table disks of up to approximately 18 exabytes in size. In theory, an unlimited number. As the July 2001, the Microsoft implementation is 128 partitions. The number of partitions is limited by the amount of space that is reserved for making partition entries. No. However, all GUID Partition Table disks contain a protective MBR that is used for legacy programs that do not understand the GUID Partition Table disk structure. The Protective MBR, beginning in sector 0, precedes the GUID Partition Table partition table on the disk. The MBR contains one type 0xEE partition that spans the entire length of the disk. This is the same regardless of the number of partitions that are defined in the GUID Partition Table disk entry array. The Protective MBR protects GUID Partition Table disks from previously-released MBR disk tools such as Microsoft MS-DOS FDISK or Microsoft Windows NT Disk Administrator. These tools are not aware of GUID Partition Table and do not know how to properly access a GUID Partition Table disk. Legacy software that does not know about GUID Partition Table interprets only the Protected MBR when it accesses a GUID Partition Table disk. These tools will view a GUID Partition Table disk as having a single encompassing (possibly unrecognized) partition by interpreting the Protected MBR, rather than mistaking the disk for one that is unpartitioned. If this occurred, you must have used an MBR-only-aware disk tool to access the GUID Partition Table disk. The EE partition in the Protective MBR is specified to be the maximum size that is allowable in an MBR. Can the 64-bit version of Windows XP read, write, and boot from GUID Partition Table disks? The 64-bit version of Windows XP can read and write GUID Partition Table disks, but cannot boot from GUID Partition Table disks. Can the 64-bit version of Windows XP read, write, and boot from MBR disks? Yes. Can the 32-bit version of Windows XP read, write, and boot from GUID Partition Table disks? No. The 32-bit version will see only the Protective MBR. The EE partition will not be mounted or otherwise exposed to program software. Can the 32-bit version of Windows XP read, write, and boot from MBR disks? Yes. Can Microsoft Windows 2000, Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, or Microsoft Windows 98/95 read, write, and boot from GUID Partition Table? No. Legacy software will see only the Protective MBR. GUID Partition Table and MBR disks can be mixed only on 64-bit systems, and the following restrictions apply: The Windows XP loader and the boot partition must reside on a GUID Partition Table disk. Other hard disks can be either MBR or GUID Partition Table. Both MBR and GUID Partition Table disks can be present in a single dynamic disk group. Volume sets can span both MBR and GUID Partition Table disks, however, the MBR cylinder alignment restriction might cause some difficulties with mirroring or striping MBR and GUID Partition Table disks. Removable media must be MBR orsuperfloppy. Removable media without either GUID Partition Table or MBR formatting is considered a superfloppy. The entire media is treated as a single partition. The media manufacturer performs any MBR partitioning of removable media; Windows never partitions removable media. If the media does have an MBR, only one partition is supported. There is little user-discernible difference between MBR-partitioned media and superfloppies. Examples of removable media include floppy disks, JAZZ disk cartridges, magneto-optical media, DVD-ROM, and CD-ROM. Hard disk drives on external buses such as SCSI or IEEE 1394 are not considered removable. What is the default behavior of the 64-bit version of Windows XP when partitioning media? Fixed disks are partitioned by using GUID Partition Table partitioning. GUID Partition Table disks can be converted to MBR disks only if all existing partitioning is first deleted, with associated loss of data. What is the default behavior of the 32-bit version of Windows XP when partitioning media? Only MBR disks can be used. MBR disks cannot be converted to GUID Partition Table disks. How can a drive letter in the operating system be mapped to a partition in Extensible Firmware Interface Firmware? There is no inherent mapping between drive letter and partition that can be used to determine one from the other. A basic data partition must be identified by its partition GUID. How can an Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition be created? Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions can be created by using the Extensible Firmware Interface firmware utility Diskpart.efi or the Windows XP command-line utility Diskpart.exe, or they can be created programmatically by using IOCTL_SET_DRIVE_LAYOUT . You should not change any partition header entry directly. Do not use disk tools or utilities to make alterations or changes. Detachable disks are commonly expected to migrate between computers or simply to be unavailable to the operating system at times. Examples of detachable disks are IEEE 1394 disks, which can be easily disconnected by the end user, or Microsoft Cluster Services (MSCS) shared disks, which move between nodes in a cluster. Windows XP supports only MBR partitioning on detachable disks. What is the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition? The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition contains the NTLDR, Boot.ini, and other files that are necessary to boot the computer, such as drivers. The Partition GUID defines the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition: DEFINE_GUID (PARTITION_SYSTEM_GUID, 0xC12A7328L, 0xF81F, 0x11D2, 0xBA, 0x4B, 0x00, 0xA0, 0xC9, 0x3E, 0xC9, 0x3B) Do only GUID Partition Table disks have Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions? No, MBR disks can also have Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions. Extensible Firmware Interface specifies booting from either GUID Partition Table or MBR. The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions on an MBR disk is identified by partition type 0xEF. However, Windows XP does not support booting Extensible Firmware Interface from MBR disks or 0xEF partitions. How big is the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition? The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is determined by using the following algorithm: Max (100MB, min (1 percent of physical disk, 1GB)) In other words, the size of the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition must be the larger of these two numbers, 100 MB or 1 percent of the physical disk size (up to 1 GB). The physical disk size is measured at the time of disk partitioning. The value 1 percent of the physical disk is calculated at the time that the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is created and does not change if the disk is extended later (for example, by using RAID). Can there be two Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions on a single disk? Such a configuration should not be created and will not be supported. What about two Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions on two different disks? Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions can be replicated for high-availability configurations. Replication must be done manually and the contents must be synchronized manually. Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions cannot be mirrored. What does Microsoft place in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition? Microsoft places the loader, and other files that are necessary to boot the operating system in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. Where should the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition be placed on the disk? The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition must be first on the disk. While there is no architectural requirement, there are numerous reasons why it is beneficial to place the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition first. The primary reason for this is that it is impossible to span volumes when the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is logically between the two data partitions you are attempting to span. What should a computer or device manufacturer place in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition? The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition should only include files that are required for booting an operating system, platform tools that run before operating system boot, or files that must be accessed before operating system boot, for example in performing pre-boot system maintenance. Other value-added files or diagnostics that are used while the operating system is running should not be placed in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. It is important to note that the space in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is a limited system resource; its primary purpose is to provide storage for the files that are necessary to boot the operating system. The preferred option is for computer manufacturers to place value-added contents in an OEM-specific partition. Just like MBR OEM partitions, the contents of GUID Partition Table OEM (or other unrecognized) partitions are not exposed (given drive letters or returned in volume lists). Users are warned that deleting the partition can cause the computer to fail to operate. An OEM-specific partition should be placed before the Microsoft Reserved Partition and after any Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition on the disk. Although not architectural, this placement has the same benefits as placing the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition first. For example, it is also impossible to span volumes when an OEM-specific partition is logically between the two data partitions you are attempting to span. Placement in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is an option for programs or files that run in the pre-operating system boot environment. However, the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is architecturally-shared space and represents a limited resource.

Each basic data partition is represented in Windows as a volume device object, and optionally as a mount point or a drive letter. It has the following partition type GUID: DEFINE_GUID (PARTITION_BASIC_DATA_GUID, 0xEBD0A0A2L, 0xB9E5, 0x4433, 0x87, 0xC0, 0x68, 0xB6, 0xB7, 0x26, 0x99, 0xC7) The user won't see these partitions exposed in Windows Explorer, nor is any recognized file system exposed to legacy programs such as Context Indexing.

Dynamic disks use two different GUID Partition Table partitions: A data container partition corresponding to the MBR partition 0x42, with the following GUID:DEFINE_GUID (PARTITION_LDM_DATA_GUID, 0xAF9B60A0L, 0x1431, 0x4F62, 0xBC, 0x68, 0x33, 0x11, 0x71, 0x4A, 0x69, 0xAD) A partition to contain the dynamic configuration database, with the following GUID:DEFINE_GUID(PARTITION_LDM_METADATA_GUID, 0x5808C8AAL, 0x7E8F, 0x42E0, 0x85, 0xD2, 0xE1, 0xE9, 0x04, 0x34, 0xCF, 0xB3)
Volumes are created in the data container and are mounted by default. This is the same as the contents of 0x42 MBR partitions. For a drive to be eligible for conversion to dynamic, all basic data partitions on the drive must be contiguous. If other unrecognized partitions separate basic data partitions, the disk cannot be converted. This is one of the reasons that the Microsoft Reserved Partition must be created before any basic data partitions. The first step in conversion is to separate a portion of the Microsoft Reserved Partition to create the configuration database partition. All non-bootable basic partitions are then combined into a single data container partition. Boot partitions are retained as separate data container partitions. This is analogous to conversion of primary partitions. Windows XP differs from Windows 2000 in that basic and extended partitions are preferentially converted to a single 0x42 partition, rather than being retained as multiple distinct 0x42 partitions as on Windows 2000. You can access the GUID Partition Table disk partitions of different types by using the following tools. Diskpart.efi:Firmware: Extensible Firmware Interface System PartitionMicrosoft Reserved Partition Diskpart.exe:Windows XP: Extensible Firmware Interface System PartitionMicrosoft Reserved Partition Diskgmt.msc:Windows XP: Extensible Firmware Interface System PartitionDATA Explorer.exe:Windows XP: DATA You can also develop your own tools (by using the Microsoft Win32 or Microsoft Win64 APIs) to access the GUID Partition Table disk partitions at their primitive levels. GUID Partition Table and MBR disks are managed the same way. Disks can be formatted as GUID Partition Table or MBR by using the Diskpart.exe command-line utility or by using the Disk Management snap-in. Volumes can be created on both GUID Partition Table and MBR disks, and both kinds of disks can be mixed in the same dynamic disk group. There is no FTdisk set support on Windows XP for MBR or GUID Partition Table disks. The only support for logical volumes is through dynamic disks. Yes, but only if the disk contains no partitions or volumes. Any data on the disk will be destroyed. GUID Partition Table disks are only supported on the 64-bit version of Windows XP. NTFS is recommended on all basic data partitions and all dynamic volumes. Windows Setup and the Disk Management snap-in offer only NTFS. However, you can still use FAT16 and FAT32 on these partitions as well. To circumvent this, the partition or volume must be formatted explicitly by using the Format tool. No. The Disk and Partition GUIDs will no longer be unique. This must never happen. You can make a sector-by-sector copy of the contents of Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition or basic data partitions. Yes; however, there are some key caveats. The OEM Preinstallation Kit (OPK) initializes the Disk and Partition GUIDs to zero. On first boot of Windows XP, the operating system generates unique GUIDs. The OPK only supports generation of Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition, Microsoft Reserved Partition, and basic data partitions. If a program has recorded any Disk or Partition GUIDs, the program may not work. Any programs, drivers, utilities, or firmware implementations that are supplied by computer manufacturers or program vendors that rely on GUIDs should be capable of handling GUIDs that change from the OPK initialization values to those that are generated by the operating system. It is a way for OEMs to simplify operating system pre-installation and system recovery. This command can easily be extended to create a default disk configuration for the platform. For example, the computer manufacturer could extend the MAKE command to automatically partition the boot drive with an Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition, Microsoft Reserved Partition, an OEM-specific partition, and one basic data partition. For example, consider a possible disk configuration called BOOT_DISK. In the event of disaster recovery, MAKE BOOT_DISK would allow the customer to completely repartition a boot disk to the original factory defaults. Windows XP will generate new GUIDs for any duplicate Disk GUID, Microsoft Reserved Partition GUID, or Microsoft Reserved Partition basic data GUID upon detection. This is similar to the duplicate MBR signature handling in Windows 2000. Duplicate GUIDs on a dynamic container or database partition cause unpredictable results. This depends on the cluster size that is selected at the time of formatting. NTFS is currently limited to 2^32-1 allocation units. This yields a 256TB volume, using 64k clusters. However, this has only been tested to 16TB, or 17,592,186,040,320 bytes, using 4K cluster size. The following chart shows the NTFS limits based on cluster size: For example, to format a volume that has a cluster size of 8 KB, you would use a command such as the following from a command prompt, where/a: ####specifies the number of bytes per cluster: If you choose a cluster size that is too small for the size of the partition, you receive the following error message when you try to format the partition: The format operation did not complete because the cluster count is higher than expected To determine the cluster size of a volume, run the following command at a command prompt, and then note theBytes Per Clustervalue: Note The <volume> placeholder represents the volume letter. For example, when you run thefsutil fsinfo ntfsinfo c:command, you may receive results that resemble the following output: NTFS Volume Serial Number : 0xf4300f6c300f3560Version : 3.1Number Sectors : 0x000000001d17dbeeTotal Clusters : 0x0000000003a2fb7dFree Clusters : 0x000000000102bfa0Total Reserved : 0x0000000000000800Bytes Per Sector : 512Bytes Per Cluster : 4096Bytes Per FileRecord Segment : 1024Clusters Per FileRecord Segment : 0Mft Valid Data Length : 0x000000000e630000Mft Start Lcn : 0x00000000000c0000Mft2 Start Lcn : 0x0000000001d17dbeMft Zone Start : 0x00000000002185a0Mft Zone End : 0x0000000000218740RM Identifier : 1587CC47-A713-11DB-9287-806E6F6E6963 Note In this example, theBytes Per Clustervalue is 4096. This value represents a 4-kilobyte (KB) cluster size.

How does switching from CSM enabled Legacy BIOS boot (Config #3) to CSM enabled UEFI boot (Config #2) impact Secure Boot behavior?,"Secure Boot is only supported in UEFI mode with the CSM disabled. If Secure Boot was not pre-configured on the factory floor prior to system shipping out to customers, then you will probably not have the option available to you. If the system did previously have Secure Boot enabled, but disabled for current Windows 7 OS (using downgrade rights) then it may be as simple as disabling the CSM and enabling Secure Boot. However, if partition was cleaned and you are not setup for UEFI boot to GPT disk. Then you will need to clean the disk and re-install the operating system for UEFI boot prior to turning on Secure Boot.

Applies to:Windows Server 2012 R2Original KB number:302873 Important This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, seeHow to back up and restore the registry in Windows. The GUID Partition Table disk architecture was introduced as part of the Extensible Firmware Interface initiative. GUID Partition Table is a new disk architecture that expands on the older Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning scheme that has been common to Intel-based computers. A partition is a contiguous space of storage on a physical or logical disk that functions as though it were a physically separate disk. Partitions are visible to the system firmware and the installed operating systems. Access to a partition is controlled by the system firmware and the operating system that is currently active. GUID Partition Table disks can grow to a large size. As of July 2001, the Microsoft implementation supports a hard disk of up to 18 EB (512 KB LBAs). The number of partitions on a GUID Partition Table disk is not constrained by temporary schemes such as container partitions as defined by the MBR Extended Boot Record. The Microsoft implementation of GUID Partition Table is limited to 128 partitions. However, it is important to note that one partition is used for the EFI System Partition, one for the Microsoft Reserved and two more are used if you use dynamic disks. This leaves 124 partitions for data use. The GUID Partition Table disk partition format is well defined and fully self-identifying. Data that is critical to the operating system is located in partitions and not in unpartitioned orhiddensectors. GUID Partition Table does not allow for hidden sectors or partitions. GUID Partition Table disks use primary and backup partition tables for redundancy and CRC32 fields for improved partition data structure integrity. The GUID Partition Table partition format uses version number and size fields for future expansion. Each GUID Partition Table partition has a unique identification GUID and a partition content type, so no coordination is necessary to prevent partition identifier collision. Each GUID Partition Table partition has a 36-character Unicode name, which means that any software can present an easily readable name for the partition without any additional understanding of the partition. MBR disks support only four primary partitions table entries or multiple logical partitions in the extended partition. If more partitions are wanted, a secondary structure, an extended partition, is necessary. Extended partitions are then subdivided into one or more logical disks. Only one extended partition can be present on any given drive, and the maximum number of logical drives is MAXULONG/4. All MBR disk partitions and logical drives must be cylinder-aligned, even on hardware RAID sets that are built from multiple different drives with no clear underlying physical geometry. MBR partitioning rules are complex and poorly specified. For example, does cylinder alignment mean that each partition must be at least one cylinder in length? An MBR partition is identified by a two-byte field, and coordination is necessary to avoid collision. IBM originally provided that coordination, but as of July 2001, there is no single authoritative list of partition identifiers. Another common practice is to use partitioned or ""hidden"" sectors to hold specific information. That practice is undocumented and results in severe system problems that are difficult to debug. Over the years, broken implementations and tools have been released to the public, making support difficult. Chapter 16 of the Extensible Firmware Interface specification defines the GUID Partition Table format. This document is available at the following Intel Web site: The Unified EFI Specification Defines an Interface Between an Operating System and Platform Firmware Third-party information disclaimer The third-party products that this article discusses are manufactured by companies that are independent of Microsoft. Microsoft makes no warranty, implied or otherwise, about the performance or reliability of these products. No. GUID Partition Table disks are self-identifying. All the information that is needed to interpret the partitioning scheme of a GUID Partition Table disk is completely contained in structures in specified locations on the physical media. In theory, a GUID Partition Table disk can be up to 264 sectors in a single logical block in length. Logical blocks are commonly 512 bytes or one sector in size. In practice, Windows XP supports GUID Partition Table disks of up to approximately 18 exabytes in size. In theory, an unlimited number. As the July 2001, the Microsoft implementation is 128 partitions. The number of partitions is limited by the amount of space that is reserved for making partition entries. No. However, all GUID Partition Table disks contain a protective MBR that is used for legacy programs that do not understand the GUID Partition Table disk structure. The Protective MBR, beginning in sector 0, precedes the GUID Partition Table partition table on the disk. The MBR contains one type 0xEE partition that spans the entire length of the disk. This is the same regardless of the number of partitions that are defined in the GUID Partition Table disk entry array. The Protective MBR protects GUID Partition Table disks from previously-released MBR disk tools such as Microsoft MS-DOS FDISK or Microsoft Windows NT Disk Administrator. These tools are not aware of GUID Partition Table and do not know how to properly access a GUID Partition Table disk. Legacy software that does not know about GUID Partition Table interprets only the Protected MBR when it accesses a GUID Partition Table disk. These tools will view a GUID Partition Table disk as having a single encompassing (possibly unrecognized) partition by interpreting the Protected MBR, rather than mistaking the disk for one that is unpartitioned. If this occurred, you must have used an MBR-only-aware disk tool to access the GUID Partition Table disk. The EE partition in the Protective MBR is specified to be the maximum size that is allowable in an MBR. Can the 64-bit version of Windows XP read, write, and boot from GUID Partition Table disks? The 64-bit version of Windows XP can read and write GUID Partition Table disks, but cannot boot from GUID Partition Table disks. Can the 64-bit version of Windows XP read, write, and boot from MBR disks? Yes. Can the 32-bit version of Windows XP read, write, and boot from GUID Partition Table disks? No. The 32-bit version will see only the Protective MBR. The EE partition will not be mounted or otherwise exposed to program software. Can the 32-bit version of Windows XP read, write, and boot from MBR disks? Yes. Can Microsoft Windows 2000, Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, or Microsoft Windows 98/95 read, write, and boot from GUID Partition Table? No. Legacy software will see only the Protective MBR. GUID Partition Table and MBR disks can be mixed only on 64-bit systems, and the following restrictions apply: The Windows XP loader and the boot partition must reside on a GUID Partition Table disk. Other hard disks can be either MBR or GUID Partition Table. Both MBR and GUID Partition Table disks can be present in a single dynamic disk group. Volume sets can span both MBR and GUID Partition Table disks, however, the MBR cylinder alignment restriction might cause some difficulties with mirroring or striping MBR and GUID Partition Table disks. Removable media must be MBR orsuperfloppy. Removable media without either GUID Partition Table or MBR formatting is considered a superfloppy. The entire media is treated as a single partition. The media manufacturer performs any MBR partitioning of removable media; Windows never partitions removable media. If the media does have an MBR, only one partition is supported. There is little user-discernible difference between MBR-partitioned media and superfloppies. Examples of removable media include floppy disks, JAZZ disk cartridges, magneto-optical media, DVD-ROM, and CD-ROM. Hard disk drives on external buses such as SCSI or IEEE 1394 are not considered removable. What is the default behavior of the 64-bit version of Windows XP when partitioning media? Fixed disks are partitioned by using GUID Partition Table partitioning. GUID Partition Table disks can be converted to MBR disks only if all existing partitioning is first deleted, with associated loss of data. What is the default behavior of the 32-bit version of Windows XP when partitioning media? Only MBR disks can be used. MBR disks cannot be converted to GUID Partition Table disks. How can a drive letter in the operating system be mapped to a partition in Extensible Firmware Interface Firmware? There is no inherent mapping between drive letter and partition that can be used to determine one from the other. A basic data partition must be identified by its partition GUID. How can an Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition be created? Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions can be created by using the Extensible Firmware Interface firmware utility Diskpart.efi or the Windows XP command-line utility Diskpart.exe, or they can be created programmatically by using IOCTL_SET_DRIVE_LAYOUT . You should not change any partition header entry directly. Do not use disk tools or utilities to make alterations or changes. Detachable disks are commonly expected to migrate between computers or simply to be unavailable to the operating system at times. Examples of detachable disks are IEEE 1394 disks, which can be easily disconnected by the end user, or Microsoft Cluster Services (MSCS) shared disks, which move between nodes in a cluster. Windows XP supports only MBR partitioning on detachable disks. What is the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition? The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition contains the NTLDR, Boot.ini, and other files that are necessary to boot the computer, such as drivers. The Partition GUID defines the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition: DEFINE_GUID (PARTITION_SYSTEM_GUID, 0xC12A7328L, 0xF81F, 0x11D2, 0xBA, 0x4B, 0x00, 0xA0, 0xC9, 0x3E, 0xC9, 0x3B) Do only GUID Partition Table disks have Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions? No, MBR disks can also have Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions. Extensible Firmware Interface specifies booting from either GUID Partition Table or MBR. The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions on an MBR disk is identified by partition type 0xEF. However, Windows XP does not support booting Extensible Firmware Interface from MBR disks or 0xEF partitions. How big is the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition? The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is determined by using the following algorithm: Max (100MB, min (1 percent of physical disk, 1GB)) In other words, the size of the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition must be the larger of these two numbers, 100 MB or 1 percent of the physical disk size (up to 1 GB). The physical disk size is measured at the time of disk partitioning. The value 1 percent of the physical disk is calculated at the time that the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is created and does not change if the disk is extended later (for example, by using RAID). Can there be two Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions on a single disk? Such a configuration should not be created and will not be supported. What about two Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions on two different disks? Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions can be replicated for high-availability configurations. Replication must be done manually and the contents must be synchronized manually. Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions cannot be mirrored. What does Microsoft place in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition? Microsoft places the loader, and other files that are necessary to boot the operating system in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. Where should the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition be placed on the disk? The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition must be first on the disk. While there is no architectural requirement, there are numerous reasons why it is beneficial to place the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition first. The primary reason for this is that it is impossible to span volumes when the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is logically between the two data partitions you are attempting to span. What should a computer or device manufacturer place in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition? The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition should only include files that are required for booting an operating system, platform tools that run before operating system boot, or files that must be accessed before operating system boot, for example in performing pre-boot system maintenance. Other value-added files or diagnostics that are used while the operating system is running should not be placed in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. It is important to note that the space in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is a limited system resource; its primary purpose is to provide storage for the files that are necessary to boot the operating system. The preferred option is for computer manufacturers to place value-added contents in an OEM-specific partition. Just like MBR OEM partitions, the contents of GUID Partition Table OEM (or other unrecognized) partitions are not exposed (given drive letters or returned in volume lists). Users are warned that deleting the partition can cause the computer to fail to operate. An OEM-specific partition should be placed before the Microsoft Reserved Partition and after any Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition on the disk. Although not architectural, this placement has the same benefits as placing the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition first. For example, it is also impossible to span volumes when an OEM-specific partition is logically between the two data partitions you are attempting to span. Placement in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is an option for programs or files that run in the pre-operating system boot environment. However, the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is architecturally-shared space and represents a limited resource. Consuming space in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition should be considered carefully. Files that are not relevant to the pre-operating system boot environment should not be placed in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. What is a Microsoft Reserved Partition? The Microsoft Reserved Partition reserves space on each disk drive for subsequent use by operating system software. GUID Partition Table disks do not allow hidden sectors. Software components that formerly used hidden sectors now allocate portions of the Microsoft Reserved Partition for component-specific partitions. For example, converting a basic disk to a dynamic disk causes the Microsoft Reserved Partition on that disk to be reduced in size and a newly created partition holds the dynamic disk database. The Microsoft Reserved Partition has the following Partition GUID: DEFINE_GUID (PARTITION_MSFT_RESERVED_GUID, 0xE3C9E316L, 0x0B5C, 0x4DB8, 0x81, 0x7D, 0xF9, 0x2D, 0xF0, 0x02, 0x15, 0xAE What disks require a Microsoft Reserved Partition? Every GUID Partition Table disk must contain a Microsoft Reserved Partition. The Microsoft Reserved Partition must be the first partition after the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition (if any) on the disk. It is particularly important that the Microsoft Reserved Partition be created before other primary data partitions. Who creates the Microsoft Reserved Partition? The Microsoft Reserved Partition must be created when disk-partitioning information is first written to the drive. If the manufacturer partitions the disk, the manufacturer must create the Microsoft Reserved Partition at the same time. If Windows partitions the disk during Setup, it creates the Microsoft Reserved Partition. Why must the Microsoft Reserved Partition be created when the disk is first partitioned? After the disk is partitioned, there will be no free space left to create a Microsoft Reserved Partition. How big is the Microsoft Reserved Partition? When initially created, the size of the Microsoft Reserved Partition depends on the size of the disk drive: Each bootable drive must contain an Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition, a Microsoft Reserved Partition, and at least one basic data partition that contains the operating system. Each data drive must contain at least a Microsoft Reserved Partition and one basic data partition. All basic data partitions on the drive should be contiguous. As previously noted, placing an OEM-specific or other unrecognized partition between data partitions imposes limitations on later volume spanning Basic data partitions correspond to primary MBR partitions 0x6 (FAT), 0x7 (NTFS), or 0xB (FAT32). There is a direct one-to-one correlation between a basic data partition and a drive letter or mount point, other volume device object, or both. Each basic data partition is represented in Windows as a volume device object, and optionally as a mount point or a drive letter. It has the following partition type GUID: DEFINE_GUID (PARTITION_BASIC_DATA_GUID, 0xEBD0A0A2L, 0xB9E5, 0x4433, 0x87, 0xC0, 0x68, 0xB6, 0xB7, 0x26, 0x99, 0xC7) The user won't see these partitions exposed in Windows Explorer, nor is any recognized file system exposed to legacy programs such as Context Indexing. The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition, OEM-specific, and other unrecognized partitions will be visible only in the Disk Management MMC snap-in. Windows XP exposes only basic data partitions. Other partitions with FAT file systems may be mounted, but not exposed (only programmatically). Only basic data partitions are assigned drive letters or mount points. The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition FAT file system is mounted, but not exposed. This allows programs running under Windows to update the contents of the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. The following registry key locates the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/System/Setup/SystemPartition The Microsoft Reserved Partition (and any partitions that are created from the Microsoft Reserved Partition) could have recognizable file systems; none are exposed. Any OEM-specific partitions or partitions that are associated with other operating systems are not recognized by Windows. Unrecognized partitions with recognizable file systems are treated like the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. They will be mounted, but not exposed. Unlike MBR disks, there is no practical difference between OEM-specific partitions and other operating system partitions; all are unrecognized. The user can use disk management tools such as the Disk Management MMC snap-in or Diskpart.exe. The Microsoft Reserved Partition and any partitions that are created from the Microsoft Reserved Partition are only visible from a command prompt. Dynamic disks use two different GUID Partition Table partitions: A data container partition corresponding to the MBR partition 0x42, with the following GUID:DEFINE_GUID (PARTITION_LDM_DATA_GUID, 0xAF9B60A0L, 0x1431, 0x4F62, 0xBC, 0x68, 0x33, 0x11, 0x71, 0x4A, 0x69, 0xAD) A partition to contain the dynamic configuration database, with the following GUID:DEFINE_GUID(PARTITION_LDM_METADATA_GUID, 0x5808C8AAL, 0x7E8F, 0x42E0, 0x85, 0xD2, 0xE1, 0xE9, 0x04, 0x34, 0xCF, 0xB3)
Volumes are created in the data container and are mounted by default. This is the same as the contents of 0x42 MBR partitions. For a drive to be eligible for conversion to dynamic, all basic data partitions on the drive must be contiguous. If other unrecognized partitions separate basic data partitions, the disk cannot be converted. This is one of the reasons that the Microsoft Reserved Partition must be created before any basic data partitions. The first step in conversion is to separate a portion of the Microsoft Reserved Partition to create the configuration database partition. All non-bootable basic partitions are then combined into a single data container partition. Boot partitions are retained as separate data container partitions. This is analogous to conversion of primary partitions. Windows XP differs from Windows 2000 in that basic and extended partitions are preferentially converted to a single 0x42 partition, rather than being retained as multiple distinct 0x42 partitions as on Windows 2000. You can access the GUID Partition Table disk partitions of different types by using the following tools. Diskpart.efi:Firmware: Extensible Firmware Interface System PartitionMicrosoft Reserved Partition Diskpart.exe:Windows XP: Extensible Firmware Interface System PartitionMicrosoft Reserved Partition Diskgmt.msc:Windows XP: Extensible Firmware Interface System PartitionDATA Explorer.exe:Windows XP: DATA You can also develop your own tools (by using the Microsoft Win32 or Microsoft Win64 APIs) to access the GUID Partition Table disk partitions at their primitive levels. GUID Partition Table and MBR disks are managed the same way. Disks can be formatted as GUID Partition Table or MBR by using the Diskpart.exe command-line utility or by using the Disk Management snap-in. Volumes can be created on both GUID Partition Table and MBR disks, and both kinds of disks can be mixed in the same dynamic disk group. There is no FTdisk set support on Windows XP for MBR or GUID Partition Table disks. The only support for logical volumes is through dynamic disks. Yes, but only if the disk contains no partitions or volumes. Any data on the disk will be destroyed. GUID Partition Table disks are only supported on the 64-bit version of Windows XP. NTFS is recommended on all basic data partitions and all dynamic volumes. Windows Setup and the Disk Management snap-in offer only NTFS. However, you can still use FAT16 and FAT32 on these partitions as well. To circumvent this, the partition or volume must be formatted explicitly by using the Format tool. No. The Disk and Partition GUIDs will no longer be unique. This must never happen. You can make a sector-by-sector copy of the contents of Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition or basic data partitions. Yes; however, there are some key caveats. The OEM Preinstallation Kit (OPK) initializes the Disk and Partition GUIDs to zero. On first boot of Windows XP, the operating system generates unique GUIDs. The OPK only supports generation of Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition, Microsoft Reserved Partition, and basic data partitions. If a program has recorded any Disk or Partition GUIDs, the program may not work. Any programs, drivers, utilities, or firmware implementations that are supplied by computer manufacturers or program vendors that rely on GUIDs should be capable of handling GUIDs that change from the OPK initialization values to those that are generated by the operating system. It is a way for OEMs to simplify operating system pre-installation and system recovery. This command can easily be extended to create a default disk configuration for the platform. For example, the computer manufacturer could extend the MAKE command to automatically partition the boot drive with an Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition, Microsoft Reserved Partition, an OEM-specific partition, and one basic data partition. For example, consider a possible disk configuration called BOOT_DISK. In the event of disaster recovery, MAKE BOOT_DISK would allow the customer to completely repartition a boot disk to the original factory defaults. Windows XP will generate new GUIDs for any duplicate Disk GUID, Microsoft Reserved Partition GUID, or Microsoft Reserved Partition basic data GUID upon detection. This is similar to the duplicate MBR signature handling in Windows 2000. Duplicate GUIDs on a dynamic container or database partition cause unpredictable results. This depends on the cluster size that is selected at the time of formatting. NTFS is currently limited to 2^32-1 allocation units. This yields a 256TB volume, using 64k clusters. However, this has only been tested to 16TB, or 17,592,186,040,320 bytes, using 4K cluster size. The following chart shows the NTFS limits based on cluster size: For example, to format a volume that has a cluster size of 8 KB, you would use a command such as the following from a command prompt, where/a: ####specifies the number of bytes per cluster: If you choose a cluster size that is too small for the size of the partition, you receive the following error message when you try to format the partition: The format operation did not complete because the cluster count is higher than expected To determine the cluster size of a volume, run the following command at a command prompt, and then note theBytes Per Clustervalue: Note The <volume> placeholder represents the volume letter. For example, when you run thefsutil fsinfo ntfsinfo c:command, you may receive results that resemble the following output: NTFS Volume Serial Number : 0xf4300f6c300f3560Version : 3.1Number Sectors : 0x000000001d17dbeeTotal Clusters : 0x0000000003a2fb7dFree Clusters : 0x000000000102bfa0Total Reserved : 0x0000000000000800Bytes Per Sector : 512Bytes Per Cluster : 4096Bytes Per FileRecord Segment : 1024Clusters Per FileRecord Segment : 0Mft Valid Data Length : 0x000000000e630000Mft Start Lcn : 0x00000000000c0000Mft2 Start Lcn : 0x0000000001d17dbeMft Zone Start : 0x00000000002185a0Mft Zone End : 0x0000000000218740RM Identifier : 1587CC47-A713-11DB-9287-806E6F6E6963 Note In this example, theBytes Per Clustervalue is 4096.

Any dependency on BitLocker and Non-Microsoft disk encryption tools?,"Yes, switching UEFI/Legacy BIOS boot will likely cause boot to fail, and switching Firmware settings back to defaults should allow recovery. Suspending bitlocker, and in some cases, disabling Bitlocker or non-MS encryption tools would be recommended depending on if switching requires wiping the drive or just changing firmware settings (such as CSM/Secure boot) 
 Consult with PC or software Manufacture for more information about configuration and defaults.","Learn more about BitLocker by reviewing the frequently asked questions. Yes, BitLocker supports multifactor authentication for operating system drives. If BitLocker is enabled on a computer that has a TPM version 1.2 or later, additional forms of authentication can be used with the TPM protection. Two partitions are required to run BitLocker because pre-startup authentication and system integrity verification must occur on a separate partition from the encrypted operating system drive. This configuration helps protect the operating system and the information in the encrypted drive. The TPM status can be checked inWindows Defender Security Center>Device Security>Security processor details. Yes, BitLocker can be enabled on an operating system drive without a TPM, if the BIOS or UEFI firmware has the ability to read from a USB flash drive in the boot environment. BitLocker won't unlock the protected drive until BitLocker's own volume master key is first released by either the computer's TPM or by a USB flash drive containing the BitLocker startup key for that computer. However, computers without TPMs won't be able to use the system integrity verification that BitLocker can also provide.
To help determine whether a computer can read from a USB device during the boot process, use the BitLocker system check as part of the BitLocker setup process. This system check performs tests to confirm that the computer can properly read from the USB devices at the appropriate time and that the computer meets other BitLocker requirements. Contact the computer manufacturer to request a Trusted Computing Group (TCG)-compliant BIOS or UEFI boot firmware that meets the following requirements: To turn on, turn off, or change configurations of BitLocker on operating system and fixed data drives, membership to the localAdministratorsgroup is required. Standard users can turn on, turn off, or change configurations of BitLocker on removable data drives. The computer's startup options should be configured to have the hard disk drive first in the boot order, before any other drives such as CD/DVD drives or USB drives. If the hard disk isn't first and the computer typically boots from the hard disk, then a boot order change may be detected or assumed when removable media is found during boot. The boot order typically affects the system measurement that is verified by BitLocker and a change in boot order will cause a prompt for the BitLocker recovery key. For the same reason, if a laptop is used with a docking station, ensure that the hard disk drive is first in the boot order both when the laptop is docked and undocked. Yes. Decryptcompletely removes BitLocker protection and fully decrypts the drive. Suspendkeeps the data encrypted but encrypts the BitLocker volume master key with a clear key. The clear key is a cryptographic key stored unencrypted and unprotected on the disk drive. By storing this key unencrypted, theSuspendoption allows for changes or upgrades to the computer without the time and cost of decrypting and re-encrypting the entire drive. After the changes are made and BitLocker is again enabled, BitLocker will reseal the encryption key to the new values of the measured components that changed as a part of the upgrade, the volume master key is changed, the protectors are updated to match and the clear key is erased. No user action is required for BitLocker in order to apply updates from Microsoft, includingWindows quality updates and feature updates.
Users need to suspend BitLocker for Non-Microsoft software updates, such as: Note If BitLocker is suspended, you can resume BitLocker protection after the upgrade or update is installed. Upon resuming protection, BitLocker will reseal the encryption key to the new values of the measured components that changed as a part of the upgrade or update. If these types of upgrades or updates are applied without suspending BitLocker, the computer will enter recovery mode when restarting and will require a recovery key or password to access the computer. Yes, the deployment and configuration BitLocker can be automated using either Windows PowerShell or with themanage-bde.execommand. For more information about common BitLocker management commands, check theBitLocker operations guide. Typically, there's a small performance overhead, often in single-digit percentages, which is relative to the throughput of the storage operations on which it needs to operate. Although BitLocker encryption occurs in the background while a user continues to work with the system remaining usable, encryption times vary depending on the type of drive that is being encrypted, the size of the drive, and the speed of the drive. If encrypting large drives, encryption may want to be scheduled during times when the drive isn't being used. When BitLocker is enabled, BitLocker can also be set to encrypt the entire drive or just the used space on the drive. On a new hard drive, encrypting just the used spaced can be considerably faster than encrypting the entire drive. When this encryption option is selected, BitLocker automatically encrypts data as it is saved, ensuring that no data is stored unencrypted. If the computer is turned off or goes into hibernation, the BitLocker encryption and decryption process will resume where it stopped the next time Windows starts. BitLocker resuming encryption or decryption is true even if the power is suddenly unavailable. No, BitLocker doesn't encrypt and decrypt the entire drive when reading and writing data. The encrypted sectors in the BitLocker-protected drive are decrypted only as they're requested from system read operations. Blocks that are written to the drive are encrypted before the system writes them to the physical disk. No unencrypted data is ever stored on a BitLocker-protected drive. Policy settings can be configured to require that data drives be BitLocker-protected before a BitLocker-protected computer can write data to them. For more info, seeBitLocker policy settings.
When these policy settings are enabled, the BitLocker-protected operating system will mount any data drives that aren't protected by BitLocker as read-only. BitLocker lets users choose to encrypt just their data. Although it's not the most secure way to encrypt a drive, this option can reduce encryption time by more than 99 percent, depending on how much data that needs to be encrypted. For more information, seeUsed Disk Space Only encryption. The following types of system changes can cause an integrity check failure and prevent the TPM from releasing the BitLocker key to decrypt the protected operating system drive: Because BitLocker is designed to protect computers from numerous attacks, there are numerous reasons why BitLocker could start in recovery mode.
For example: In BitLocker, recovery consists of decrypting a copy of the volume master key using either a recovery key stored on a USB flash drive or a cryptographic key derived from a recovery password.
The TPM isn't involved in any recovery scenarios, so recovery is still possible if the TPM fails boot component validation, malfunctions, or is removed. BitLocker can be prevented from binding to PCR 7 if a non-Windows OS booted prior to Windows, or if Secure Boot isn't available to the device, either because it's disabled or the hardware doesn't support it. Yes, multiple hard disks can be swapped on the same computer if BitLocker is enabled, but only if the hard disks were BitLocker-protected on the same computer. The BitLocker keys are unique to the TPM and the operating system drive. If a backup operating system or data drive needs to be prepared in case of a disk failure, make sure that they were matched with the correct TPM. Different hard drives can also be configured for different operating systems and then enable BitLocker on each one with different authentication methods (such as one with TPM-only and one with TPM+PIN) without any conflicts. Yes, if the drive is a data drive, it can be unlocked from theBitLocker Drive EncryptionControl Panel item by using a password or smart card. If the data drive was configured for automatic unlock only, it will need to be unlocked by using the recovery key. The encrypted hard disk can be unlocked by a data recovery agent (if one was configured) or it can be unlocked by using the recovery key. Some drives can't be encrypted with BitLocker. Reasons a drive can't be encrypted include insufficient disk size, an incompatible file system, if the drive is a dynamic disk, or a drive is designated as the system partition. By default, the system drive (or system partition) is hidden from display. However, if it isn't created as a hidden drive when the operating system was installed due to a custom installation process, that drive might be displayed but can't be encrypted. Any number of internal, fixed data drives can be protected with BitLocker. On some versions ATA and SATA-based, direct-attached storage devices are also supported. Removable data drives can be unlocked using a password or a smart card. A SID protector can also be configured to unlock a drive by using user domain credentials. After encryption has started, the drive can also be automatically unlocked on a specific computer for a specific user account. System administrators can configure which options are available for users including password complexity and minimum length requirements. To unlock by using a SID protector, usemanage-bde.exe: There are multiple keys that can be generated and used by BitLocker. Some keys are required and some are optional protectors you can choose to use depending on the level of security you require. TPM owner password Prior to enabling BitLocker on a computer with a TPM version 1.2, you must initialize the TPM. The initialization process generates a TPM owner password, which is a password set on the TPM. You must be able to supply the TPM owner password to change the state of the TPM, such as when enabling or disabling the TPM or resetting the TPM lockout. Recovery password and recovery key When you set up BitLocker, you must choose how access to BitLocker-protected drives can be recovered in the event that the specified unlock method cannot be used (such as if the TPM cannot validate the boot components, the personal identification number (PIN) is forgotten, or the password is forgotten). In these situations, you must be able to supply either the recovery key or the recovery password to unlock the encrypted data on the drive. When you supply the recovery information, you can use either of the following formats: PIN and enhanced PIN For a higher level of security with the TPM, you can configure BitLocker with a personal identification number (PIN). The PIN is a user-created value that must be entered each time the computer starts or resumes from hibernation. The PIN can consist of 4 to 20 digits as specified by theConfigure minimum PIN length for startuppolicy setting and is stored internally as a 256-bit hash of the entered Unicode characters. This value is never displayed to the user. The PIN is used to provide another factor of authentication in conjunction with TPM authentication.For an even higher level of security with the TPM, you can configure BitLocker to use enhanced PINs. Enhanced PINs are PINs that use the full keyboard character set in addition to the numeric set to allow for more possible PIN combinations and are between 4 and 20 characters in length. To use enhanced PINs, you must enable theAllow enhanced PINs for startuppolicy setting before adding the PIN to the drive. By enabling this policy, all PINs created can utilize full keyboard characters. Startup key Configuring a startup key is another method to enable a higher level of security with the TPM. The startup key is a key stored on a USB flash drive, and the USB flash drive must be inserted every time the computer starts. The startup key is used to provide another factor of authentication in conjunction with TPM authentication. To use a USB flash drive as a startup key, the USB flash drive must be formatted by using the NTFS, FAT, or FAT32 file system. Important You must have a startup key to use BitLocker on a non-TPM computer. The recovery password and recovery key for an operating system drive or a fixed data drive can be saved to a folder, saved to one or more USB devices, saved to a Microsoft Account, or printed. For removable data drives, the recovery password and recovery key can be saved to a folder, saved to a Microsoft Account, or printed. By default, a recovery key for a removable drive can't be stored on a removable drive. A domain administrator can also configure policy settings to automatically generate recovery passwords and store them in Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) or Microsoft Entra ID for any BitLocker-protected drive. TheManage-bde.execommand-line tool can be used to replace TPM-only authentication mode with a multifactor authentication mode. For example, if BitLocker is enabled with TPM authentication only and PIN authentication needs to be added, use the following commands from an elevated Command Prompt, replacing4-20 digit numeric PINwith the desired numeric PIN: New hardware that meetsWindows Hardware Compatibility Programrequirements make a PIN less critical as a mitigation, and having a TPM-only protector is likely sufficient when combined with policies like device lockout. For example, Surface Pro and Surface Book don't have external DMA ports to attack.
For older hardware, where a PIN may be needed, it's recommended to enableenhanced PINsthat allow non-numeric characters such as letters and punctuation marks, and to set the PIN length based on the risk tolerance and the hardware anti-hammering capabilities available to the TPMs on the computers. BitLocker is designed to make the encrypted drive unrecoverable without the required authentication. When in recovery mode, the user needs the recovery password or recovery key to unlock the encrypted drive. Important Store the recovery information in Microsoft Entra ID, AD DS, Microsoft Account, or another safe location. While using a USB flash drive as both the startup key and for storage of the recovery key is technically possible, it isn't a best practice to use one USB flash drive to store both keys. If the USB flash drive that contains the startup key is lost or stolen, the recovery key will also be lost. In addition, inserting this key would cause the computer to automatically boot from the recovery key even if TPM-measured files have changed, which circumvents the TPM's system integrity check. Yes, computer's startup key can be saved on multiple USB flash drives. Right-clicking a BitLocker-protected drive and selectingManage BitLockerwill provide the options to save the recovery keys on additional USB flash drives as needed. Yes, BitLocker startup keys for different  computers can be saved on the same USB flash drive. Generating different startup keys for the same computer can be done through scripting. However, for computers that have a TPM, creating different startup keys prevents BitLocker from using the TPM's system integrity check. Generating multiple PIN combinations can't be done. Raw data is encrypted with the full volume encryption key, which is then encrypted with the volume master key. The volume master key is in turn encrypted by one of several possible methods depending on the authentication (that is, key protectors or TPM) and recovery scenarios. The full volume encryption key is encrypted by the volume master key and stored in the encrypted drive. The volume master key is encrypted by the appropriate key protector and stored in the encrypted drive. If BitLocker has been suspended, the clear key that is used to encrypt the volume master key is also stored in the encrypted drive, along with the encrypted volume master key. This storage process ensures that the volume master key is never stored unencrypted and is protected unless BitLocker is disabled. The keys are also saved to two additional locations on the drive for redundancy. The keys can be read and processed by the boot manager. The F1 through F10 keys are universally mapped scan codes available in the pre-boot environment on all computers and in all languages. The numeric keys 0 through 9 aren't usable in the pre-boot environment on all keyboards. When using an enhanced PIN, users should run the optional system check during the BitLocker setup process to ensure that the PIN can be entered correctly in the pre-boot environment. It's possible that a personal identification number (PIN) can be discovered by an attacker performing a brute force attack. A brute force attack occurs when an attacker uses an automated tool to try different PIN combinations until the correct one is discovered. For BitLocker-protected computers, this type of attack, also known as a dictionary attack, requires that the attacker has physical access to the computer. The TPM has the built-in ability to detect and react to these types of attacks. Because different manufacturers' TPMs may support different PIN and attack mitigations, contact the TPM's manufacturer to determine how the computer's TPM mitigates PIN brute force attacks.
After the TPM's manufacturer is determined, contact the manufacturer to gather the TPM's vendor-specific information. Most manufacturers use the PIN authentication failure count to exponentially increase lockout time to the PIN interface. However, each manufacturer has different policies regarding when and how the failure counter is decreased or reset. The TPM manufacturer can be determined inWindows Defender Security Center>Device Security>Security processor details. The following questions can assist when asking a TPM manufacturer about the design of a dictionary attack mitigation mechanism: The minimum personal identification number (PIN) length can be configured by using theConfigure minimum PIN length for startupGroup Policy setting and allow the use of alphanumeric PINs by enabling theAllow enhanced PINs for startuppolicy setting. PIN complexity can't be required via policy settings. For more info, seeBitLocker policy settings. BitLocker hashes the user-specified personal identification number (PIN) by using SHA-256, and the first 160 bits of the hash are used as authorization data sent to the TPM to seal the volume master key. The volume master key is now protected by both the TPM and the PIN. To unseal the volume master key, you are required to enter the PIN each time the computer restarts or resumes from hibernation. BitLocker To Go is BitLocker Drive Encryption on removable data drives. This feature includes the encryption of: Drive partitioning must meet theBitLocker Drive Encryption Partitioning Requirements. As with BitLocker, drives that are encrypted by BitLocker To Go can be opened by using a password or smart card on another computer. In Control Panel, useBitLocker Drive Encryption. If BitLocker is enabled on a drive before policy settings are applied to enforce a backup, the recovery information won't be automatically backed up to AD DS when the computer joins the domain or when the policy settings are subsequently applied. However, the policy settingsChoose how BitLocker-protected operating system drives can be recovered,Choose how BitLocker-protected fixed drives can be recovered, andChoose how BitLocker-protected removable drives can be recoveredcan be chosen to require the computer to be connected to a domain before BitLocker can be enabled to help ensure that recovery information for BitLocker-protected drives in the organization is backed up to AD DS. For more information how to back up the recovery password to AD DS or Microsoft Entra ID, review theBitLocker operations guide. Important Joining a computer to the domain should be the first step for new computers within an organization. After computers are joined to a domain, storing the BitLocker recovery key to AD DS is automatic (when enabled with policy settings). Yes, an event log entry that indicates the success or failure of a backup is recorded on the client computer. However, even if an event log entry says ""Success,"" the information could have been subsequently removed from AD DS, or BitLocker could have been reconfigured in such a way that the Active Directory information can no longer unlock the drive (such as by removing the recovery password key protector). In addition, it's also possible that the log entry could be spoofed. Ultimately, determining whether a legitimate backup exists in AD DS requires querying AD DS with domain administrator credentials by using the BitLocker password viewer tool. No. By design, BitLocker recovery password entries don't get deleted from AD DS. Therefore, multiple passwords might be seen for each drive. To identify the latest password, check the date on the object. If the backup initially fails, such as when a domain controller is unreachable at the time when the BitLocker setup wizard is run, BitLocker doesn't try again to back up the recovery information to AD DS. When an administrator selects theDo not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for (operating system | fixed data | removable data) drivescheck box in any of theChoose how BitLocker-protected operating system drives can be recovered,Choose how BitLocker-protected fixed data drives can be recovered, andChoose how BitLocker-protected removable data drives can be recoveredpolicy settings, users can't enable BitLocker unless the computer is connected to the domain and the backup of BitLocker recovery information to AD DS succeeds. With these settings configured if the backup fails, BitLocker can't be enabled, ensuring that administrators will be able to recover BitLocker-protected drives in the organization. For more info, seeBitLocker policy settings. When an administrator clears these check boxes, the administrator is allowing a drive to be BitLocker-protected without having the recovery information successfully backed up to AD DS; however, BitLocker won't automatically retry the backup if it fails. Instead, administrators can create a backup script, as described earlier inWhat if BitLocker is enabled on a computer before the computer joins the domain?to capture the information after connectivity is restored. BitLocker uses Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) as its encryption algorithm with configurable key lengths of 128 bits or 256 bits. The default encryption setting is AES-128, but the options are configurable by using policy settings. The recommended practice for BitLocker configuration on an operating system drive is to implement BitLocker on a computer with a TPM version 1.2 or higher. BitLocker on operating system drives in its basic configuration provides extra security for the hibernate mode. In sleep mode, the computer is vulnerable to direct memory access attacks, since unprotected data remains in RAM. Therefore, for improved security, it's recommended to disable sleep mode. Startup authentication can be configured by using apolicy setting. Most operating systems use a shared memory space and rely on the operating system to manage physical memory. A TPM is a hardware component that uses its own internal firmware and logic circuits for processing instructions, thus shielding it from external software vulnerabilities. Attacking the TPM requires physical access to the computer. Additionally, the tools and skills necessary to attack hardware are often more expensive, and usually aren't as available as the ones used to attack software. And because each TPM is unique to the computer that contains it, attacking multiple TPM computers would be difficult and time-consuming. Note Configuring BitLocker with an additional factor of authentication provides even more protection against TPM hardware attacks. BitLocker Network Unlock enables easier management for BitLocker-enabled clients and servers that use the TPM+PIN protection method in a domain environment. When a computer that is connected to a wired corporate network is rebooted, Network Unlock allows the PIN entry prompt to be bypassed. It automatically unlocks BitLocker-protected operating system volumes by using a trusted key that is provided by the Windows Deployment Services server as its secondary authentication method. To use Network Unlock, a PIN must be configured for the computer. When the computer isn't connected to the network, a PIN will need to be provided to unlock it. BitLocker Network Unlock has software and hardware requirements for both client computers, Windows Deployment services, and domain controllers that must be met before it can be used. Network Unlock uses two protectors - the TPM protector and the protector provided by the network or by the PIN. Automatic unlock uses a single protector - the one stored in the TPM. If the computer is joined to a network without the key protector, it will prompt to enter a PIN. If the PIN isn't available, the recovery key will need to be used to unlock the computer if it can't be connected to the network. For more info, seeBitLocker: How to enable Network Unlock. Yes, Encrypting File System (EFS) can be used to encrypt files on a BitLocker-protected drive. BitLocker helps protect the entire operating system drive against offline attacks, whereas EFS can provide additional user-based file level encryption for security separation between multiple users of the same computer. EFS can also be used in Windows to encrypt files on other drives that aren't encrypted by BitLocker. The root secrets of EFS are stored by default on the operating system drive; therefore, if BitLocker is enabled for the operating system drive, data that is encrypted by EFS on other drives is also indirectly protected by BitLocker. Yes. However, the debugger should be turned on before enabling BitLocker. Turning on the debugger ensures that the correct measurements are calculated when sealing to the TPM, allowing the computer to start properly. If debugging needs to be turned on or off when using BitLocker, be sure to suspend BitLocker first to avoid putting the computer into recovery mode. BitLocker has a storage driver stack that ensures memory dumps are encrypted when BitLocker is enabled. BitLocker doesn't support smart cards for pre-boot authentication. There's no single industry standard for smart card support in the firmware, and most computers either don't implement firmware support for smart cards, or only support specific smart cards and readers. This lack of standardization makes supporting them difficult. Microsoft doesn't support non-Microsoft TPM drivers and strongly recommends against using them with BitLocker. Attempting to use a non-Microsoft TPM driver with BitLocker may cause BitLocker to report that a TPM isn't present on the computer and not allow the TPM to be used with BitLocker. We don't recommend modifying the master boot record on computers whose operating system drives are BitLocker-protected for several security, reliability, and product support reasons. Changes to the master boot record (MBR) could change the security environment and prevent the computer from starting normally and complicate any efforts to recover from a corrupted MBR. Changes made to the MBR by anything other than Windows might force the computer into recovery mode or prevent it from booting entirely. The system check is designed to ensure the computer's BIOS or UEFI firmware is compatible with BitLocker and that the TPM is working correctly. The system check can fail for several reasons: Some computers can't read USB flash drives in the pre-boot environment. First, check the BIOS or UEFI firmware and boot settings to ensure that the use of USB drives is enabled. If it isn't enabled, enable the use of USB drives in the BIOS or UEFI firmware and boot settings, and then try to read the recovery key from the USB flash drive again. If the USB flash drive still can't be read, the hard drive will need to be mounted as a data drive on another computer so that there's an operating system to attempt to read the recovery key from the USB flash drive. If the USB flash drive has been corrupted or damaged, a recovery password may need to be supplied or use the recovery information that was backed up to AD DS. Also, if the recovery key is being used in the pre-boot environment, ensure that the drive is formatted by using the NTFS, FAT16, or FAT32 file system. TheSave to USBoption isn't shown by default for removable drives. If the option is unavailable, it means that a system administrator has disallowed the use of recovery keys. Automatic unlocking for fixed data drives requires the operating system drive to also be protected by BitLocker. If a computer is being used that doesn't have a BitLocker-protected operating system drive, then the fixed drive can't be automatically unlocked. For removable data drives, automatic unlocking can be added by right-clicking the drive in Windows Explorer and selectingManage BitLocker. Password or smart card credentials that were supplied when BitLocker was turned on can still be used to unlock the removable drive on other computers. Limited BitLocker functionality is available in Safe Mode. BitLocker-protected drives can be unlocked and decrypted by using theBitLocker Drive EncryptionControl Panel item. Right-clicking to access BitLocker options from Windows Explorer isn't available in Safe Mode. Both fixed and removable data drives can be locked by using the Manage-bde command-line tool and the -lock command. Note Ensure all data is saved to the drive before locking it. Once locked, the drive will become inaccessible. The syntax of this command is: Outside of using this command, data drives will be locked on shutdown and restart of the operating system. A removable data drive will also be locked automatically when the drive is removed from the computer. Yes. However, shadow copies made prior to enabling BitLocker will be automatically deleted when BitLocker is enabled on software-encrypted drives. If a hardware encrypted drive is being used, the shadow copies are retained. BitLocker should work like any specific physical machine within its hardware limitations as long as the environment (physical or virtual) meets Windows Operating System requirements to run. BitLocker is also supported on data volume VHDs, such as those used by clusters. Yes, BitLocker can be used with virtual machines (VMs) if the environment meets BitLocker's hardware and software requirements.

How is Secure Boot configured once the BIOS is switched to UEFI?,"By default, for Win7 devices, Secure Boot is not implemented. If a system came with Windows 8 or higher, it's very likely that system would have Secure Boot configured as this was a Logo requirement. Secure Boot is only implemented on factory floor by the PC manufacturer. Please contact the PC manufacturer to see if they would be able to install Secure Boot on your system. You may need to send system back to PC manufacture to get this installed.","This article provides a list of frequently asked questions about the GUID Partition Table disk architecture. Applies to:Windows Server 2012 R2Original KB number:302873 Important This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, seeHow to back up and restore the registry in Windows. The GUID Partition Table disk architecture was introduced as part of the Extensible Firmware Interface initiative. GUID Partition Table is a new disk architecture that expands on the older Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning scheme that has been common to Intel-based computers. A partition is a contiguous space of storage on a physical or logical disk that functions as though it were a physically separate disk. Partitions are visible to the system firmware and the installed operating systems. Access to a partition is controlled by the system firmware and the operating system that is currently active. GUID Partition Table disks can grow to a large size. As of July 2001, the Microsoft implementation supports a hard disk of up to 18 EB (512 KB LBAs). The number of partitions on a GUID Partition Table disk is not constrained by temporary schemes such as container partitions as defined by the MBR Extended Boot Record. The Microsoft implementation of GUID Partition Table is limited to 128 partitions. However, it is important to note that one partition is used for the EFI System Partition, one for the Microsoft Reserved and two more are used if you use dynamic disks. This leaves 124 partitions for data use. The GUID Partition Table disk partition format is well defined and fully self-identifying. Data that is critical to the operating system is located in partitions and not in unpartitioned orhiddensectors. GUID Partition Table does not allow for hidden sectors or partitions. GUID Partition Table disks use primary and backup partition tables for redundancy and CRC32 fields for improved partition data structure integrity. The GUID Partition Table partition format uses version number and size fields for future expansion. Each GUID Partition Table partition has a unique identification GUID and a partition content type, so no coordination is necessary to prevent partition identifier collision. Each GUID Partition Table partition has a 36-character Unicode name, which means that any software can present an easily readable name for the partition without any additional understanding of the partition. MBR disks support only four primary partitions table entries or multiple logical partitions in the extended partition. If more partitions are wanted, a secondary structure, an extended partition, is necessary. Extended partitions are then subdivided into one or more logical disks. Only one extended partition can be present on any given drive, and the maximum number of logical drives is MAXULONG/4. All MBR disk partitions and logical drives must be cylinder-aligned, even on hardware RAID sets that are built from multiple different drives with no clear underlying physical geometry. MBR partitioning rules are complex and poorly specified. For example, does cylinder alignment mean that each partition must be at least one cylinder in length? An MBR partition is identified by a two-byte field, and coordination is necessary to avoid collision. IBM originally provided that coordination, but as of July 2001, there is no single authoritative list of partition identifiers. Another common practice is to use partitioned or ""hidden"" sectors to hold specific information. That practice is undocumented and results in severe system problems that are difficult to debug. Over the years, broken implementations and tools have been released to the public, making support difficult. Chapter 16 of the Extensible Firmware Interface specification defines the GUID Partition Table format. This document is available at the following Intel Web site: The Unified EFI Specification Defines an Interface Between an Operating System and Platform Firmware Third-party information disclaimer The third-party products that this article discusses are manufactured by companies that are independent of Microsoft. Microsoft makes no warranty, implied or otherwise, about the performance or reliability of these products. No. GUID Partition Table disks are self-identifying. All the information that is needed to interpret the partitioning scheme of a GUID Partition Table disk is completely contained in structures in specified locations on the physical media. In theory, a GUID Partition Table disk can be up to 264 sectors in a single logical block in length. Logical blocks are commonly 512 bytes or one sector in size. In practice, Windows XP supports GUID Partition Table disks of up to approximately 18 exabytes in size. In theory, an unlimited number. As the July 2001, the Microsoft implementation is 128 partitions. The number of partitions is limited by the amount of space that is reserved for making partition entries. No. However, all GUID Partition Table disks contain a protective MBR that is used for legacy programs that do not understand the GUID Partition Table disk structure. The Protective MBR, beginning in sector 0, precedes the GUID Partition Table partition table on the disk. The MBR contains one type 0xEE partition that spans the entire length of the disk. This is the same regardless of the number of partitions that are defined in the GUID Partition Table disk entry array. The Protective MBR protects GUID Partition Table disks from previously-released MBR disk tools such as Microsoft MS-DOS FDISK or Microsoft Windows NT Disk Administrator. These tools are not aware of GUID Partition Table and do not know how to properly access a GUID Partition Table disk. Legacy software that does not know about GUID Partition Table interprets only the Protected MBR when it accesses a GUID Partition Table disk. These tools will view a GUID Partition Table disk as having a single encompassing (possibly unrecognized) partition by interpreting the Protected MBR, rather than mistaking the disk for one that is unpartitioned. If this occurred, you must have used an MBR-only-aware disk tool to access the GUID Partition Table disk. The EE partition in the Protective MBR is specified to be the maximum size that is allowable in an MBR. Can the 64-bit version of Windows XP read, write, and boot from GUID Partition Table disks? The 64-bit version of Windows XP can read and write GUID Partition Table disks, but cannot boot from GUID Partition Table disks. Can the 64-bit version of Windows XP read, write, and boot from MBR disks? Yes. Can the 32-bit version of Windows XP read, write, and boot from GUID Partition Table disks? No. The 32-bit version will see only the Protective MBR. The EE partition will not be mounted or otherwise exposed to program software. Can the 32-bit version of Windows XP read, write, and boot from MBR disks? Yes. Can Microsoft Windows 2000, Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, or Microsoft Windows 98/95 read, write, and boot from GUID Partition Table? No. Legacy software will see only the Protective MBR. GUID Partition Table and MBR disks can be mixed only on 64-bit systems, and the following restrictions apply: The Windows XP loader and the boot partition must reside on a GUID Partition Table disk. Other hard disks can be either MBR or GUID Partition Table. Both MBR and GUID Partition Table disks can be present in a single dynamic disk group. Volume sets can span both MBR and GUID Partition Table disks, however, the MBR cylinder alignment restriction might cause some difficulties with mirroring or striping MBR and GUID Partition Table disks. Removable media must be MBR orsuperfloppy. Removable media without either GUID Partition Table or MBR formatting is considered a superfloppy. The entire media is treated as a single partition. The media manufacturer performs any MBR partitioning of removable media; Windows never partitions removable media. If the media does have an MBR, only one partition is supported. There is little user-discernible difference between MBR-partitioned media and superfloppies. Examples of removable media include floppy disks, JAZZ disk cartridges, magneto-optical media, DVD-ROM, and CD-ROM. Hard disk drives on external buses such as SCSI or IEEE 1394 are not considered removable. What is the default behavior of the 64-bit version of Windows XP when partitioning media? Fixed disks are partitioned by using GUID Partition Table partitioning. GUID Partition Table disks can be converted to MBR disks only if all existing partitioning is first deleted, with associated loss of data. What is the default behavior of the 32-bit version of Windows XP when partitioning media? Only MBR disks can be used. MBR disks cannot be converted to GUID Partition Table disks. How can a drive letter in the operating system be mapped to a partition in Extensible Firmware Interface Firmware? There is no inherent mapping between drive letter and partition that can be used to determine one from the other. A basic data partition must be identified by its partition GUID. How can an Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition be created? Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions can be created by using the Extensible Firmware Interface firmware utility Diskpart.efi or the Windows XP command-line utility Diskpart.exe, or they can be created programmatically by using IOCTL_SET_DRIVE_LAYOUT . You should not change any partition header entry directly. Do not use disk tools or utilities to make alterations or changes. Detachable disks are commonly expected to migrate between computers or simply to be unavailable to the operating system at times. Examples of detachable disks are IEEE 1394 disks, which can be easily disconnected by the end user, or Microsoft Cluster Services (MSCS) shared disks, which move between nodes in a cluster. Windows XP supports only MBR partitioning on detachable disks. What is the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition? The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition contains the NTLDR, Boot.ini, and other files that are necessary to boot the computer, such as drivers. The Partition GUID defines the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition: DEFINE_GUID (PARTITION_SYSTEM_GUID, 0xC12A7328L, 0xF81F, 0x11D2, 0xBA, 0x4B, 0x00, 0xA0, 0xC9, 0x3E, 0xC9, 0x3B) Do only GUID Partition Table disks have Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions? No, MBR disks can also have Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions. Extensible Firmware Interface specifies booting from either GUID Partition Table or MBR. The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions on an MBR disk is identified by partition type 0xEF. However, Windows XP does not support booting Extensible Firmware Interface from MBR disks or 0xEF partitions. How big is the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition? The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is determined by using the following algorithm: Max (100MB, min (1 percent of physical disk, 1GB)) In other words, the size of the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition must be the larger of these two numbers, 100 MB or 1 percent of the physical disk size (up to 1 GB). The physical disk size is measured at the time of disk partitioning. The value 1 percent of the physical disk is calculated at the time that the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is created and does not change if the disk is extended later (for example, by using RAID). Can there be two Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions on a single disk? Such a configuration should not be created and will not be supported. What about two Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions on two different disks? Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions can be replicated for high-availability configurations. Replication must be done manually and the contents must be synchronized manually. Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions cannot be mirrored. What does Microsoft place in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition? Microsoft places the loader, and other files that are necessary to boot the operating system in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. Where should the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition be placed on the disk? The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition must be first on the disk. While there is no architectural requirement, there are numerous reasons why it is beneficial to place the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition first. The primary reason for this is that it is impossible to span volumes when the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is logically between the two data partitions you are attempting to span. What should a computer or device manufacturer place in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition? The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition should only include files that are required for booting an operating system, platform tools that run before operating system boot, or files that must be accessed before operating system boot, for example in performing pre-boot system maintenance. Other value-added files or diagnostics that are used while the operating system is running should not be placed in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. It is important to note that the space in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is a limited system resource; its primary purpose is to provide storage for the files that are necessary to boot the operating system. The preferred option is for computer manufacturers to place value-added contents in an OEM-specific partition. Just like MBR OEM partitions, the contents of GUID Partition Table OEM (or other unrecognized) partitions are not exposed (given drive letters or returned in volume lists). Users are warned that deleting the partition can cause the computer to fail to operate. An OEM-specific partition should be placed before the Microsoft Reserved Partition and after any Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition on the disk. Although not architectural, this placement has the same benefits as placing the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition first. For example, it is also impossible to span volumes when an OEM-specific partition is logically between the two data partitions you are attempting to span. Placement in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is an option for programs or files that run in the pre-operating system boot environment. However, the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is architecturally-shared space and represents a limited resource. Consuming space in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition should be considered carefully. Files that are not relevant to the pre-operating system boot environment should not be placed in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. What is a Microsoft Reserved Partition? The Microsoft Reserved Partition reserves space on each disk drive for subsequent use by operating system software. GUID Partition Table disks do not allow hidden sectors. Software components that formerly used hidden sectors now allocate portions of the Microsoft Reserved Partition for component-specific partitions. For example, converting a basic disk to a dynamic disk causes the Microsoft Reserved Partition on that disk to be reduced in size and a newly created partition holds the dynamic disk database. The Microsoft Reserved Partition has the following Partition GUID: DEFINE_GUID (PARTITION_MSFT_RESERVED_GUID, 0xE3C9E316L, 0x0B5C, 0x4DB8, 0x81, 0x7D, 0xF9, 0x2D, 0xF0, 0x02, 0x15, 0xAE What disks require a Microsoft Reserved Partition? Every GUID Partition Table disk must contain a Microsoft Reserved Partition. The Microsoft Reserved Partition must be the first partition after the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition (if any) on the disk. It is particularly important that the Microsoft Reserved Partition be created before other primary data partitions. Who creates the Microsoft Reserved Partition? The Microsoft Reserved Partition must be created when disk-partitioning information is first written to the drive. If the manufacturer partitions the disk, the manufacturer must create the Microsoft Reserved Partition at the same time. If Windows partitions the disk during Setup, it creates the Microsoft Reserved Partition. Why must the Microsoft Reserved Partition be created when the disk is first partitioned? After the disk is partitioned, there will be no free space left to create a Microsoft Reserved Partition. How big is the Microsoft Reserved Partition? When initially created, the size of the Microsoft Reserved Partition depends on the size of the disk drive: Each bootable drive must contain an Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition, a Microsoft Reserved Partition, and at least one basic data partition that contains the operating system. Each data drive must contain at least a Microsoft Reserved Partition and one basic data partition. All basic data partitions on the drive should be contiguous. As previously noted, placing an OEM-specific or other unrecognized partition between data partitions imposes limitations on later volume spanning Basic data partitions correspond to primary MBR partitions 0x6 (FAT), 0x7 (NTFS), or 0xB (FAT32). There is a direct one-to-one correlation between a basic data partition and a drive letter or mount point, other volume device object, or both. Each basic data partition is represented in Windows as a volume device object, and optionally as a mount point or a drive letter. It has the following partition type GUID: DEFINE_GUID (PARTITION_BASIC_DATA_GUID, 0xEBD0A0A2L, 0xB9E5, 0x4433, 0x87, 0xC0, 0x68, 0xB6, 0xB7, 0x26, 0x99, 0xC7) The user won't see these partitions exposed in Windows Explorer, nor is any recognized file system exposed to legacy programs such as Context Indexing. The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition, OEM-specific, and other unrecognized partitions will be visible only in the Disk Management MMC snap-in. Windows XP exposes only basic data partitions. Other partitions with FAT file systems may be mounted, but not exposed (only programmatically). Only basic data partitions are assigned drive letters or mount points. The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition FAT file system is mounted, but not exposed. This allows programs running under Windows to update the contents of the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. The following registry key locates the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/System/Setup/SystemPartition The Microsoft Reserved Partition (and any partitions that are created from the Microsoft Reserved Partition) could have recognizable file systems; none are exposed. Any OEM-specific partitions or partitions that are associated with other operating systems are not recognized by Windows. Unrecognized partitions with recognizable file systems are treated like the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. They will be mounted, but not exposed. Unlike MBR disks, there is no practical difference between OEM-specific partitions and other operating system partitions; all are unrecognized. The user can use disk management tools such as the Disk Management MMC snap-in or Diskpart.exe. The Microsoft Reserved Partition and any partitions that are created from the Microsoft Reserved Partition are only visible from a command prompt. Dynamic disks use two different GUID Partition Table partitions: A data container partition corresponding to the MBR partition 0x42, with the following GUID:DEFINE_GUID (PARTITION_LDM_DATA_GUID, 0xAF9B60A0L, 0x1431, 0x4F62, 0xBC, 0x68, 0x33, 0x11, 0x71, 0x4A, 0x69, 0xAD) A partition to contain the dynamic configuration database, with the following GUID:DEFINE_GUID(PARTITION_LDM_METADATA_GUID, 0x5808C8AAL, 0x7E8F, 0x42E0, 0x85, 0xD2, 0xE1, 0xE9, 0x04, 0x34, 0xCF, 0xB3)
Volumes are created in the data container and are mounted by default. This is the same as the contents of 0x42 MBR partitions. For a drive to be eligible for conversion to dynamic, all basic data partitions on the drive must be contiguous. If other unrecognized partitions separate basic data partitions, the disk cannot be converted. This is one of the reasons that the Microsoft Reserved Partition must be created before any basic data partitions. The first step in conversion is to separate a portion of the Microsoft Reserved Partition to create the configuration database partition. All non-bootable basic partitions are then combined into a single data container partition. Boot partitions are retained as separate data container partitions. This is analogous to conversion of primary partitions. Windows XP differs from Windows 2000 in that basic and extended partitions are preferentially converted to a single 0x42 partition, rather than being retained as multiple distinct 0x42 partitions as on Windows 2000. You can access the GUID Partition Table disk partitions of different types by using the following tools. Diskpart.efi:Firmware: Extensible Firmware Interface System PartitionMicrosoft Reserved Partition Diskpart.exe:Windows XP: Extensible Firmware Interface System PartitionMicrosoft Reserved Partition Diskgmt.msc:Windows XP: Extensible Firmware Interface System PartitionDATA Explorer.exe:Windows XP: DATA You can also develop your own tools (by using the Microsoft Win32 or Microsoft Win64 APIs) to access the GUID Partition Table disk partitions at their primitive levels. GUID Partition Table and MBR disks are managed the same way. Disks can be formatted as GUID Partition Table or MBR by using the Diskpart.exe command-line utility or by using the Disk Management snap-in. Volumes can be created on both GUID Partition Table and MBR disks, and both kinds of disks can be mixed in the same dynamic disk group. There is no FTdisk set support on Windows XP for MBR or GUID Partition Table disks. The only support for logical volumes is through dynamic disks. Yes, but only if the disk contains no partitions or volumes. Any data on the disk will be destroyed. GUID Partition Table disks are only supported on the 64-bit version of Windows XP. NTFS is recommended on all basic data partitions and all dynamic volumes. Windows Setup and the Disk Management snap-in offer only NTFS. However, you can still use FAT16 and FAT32 on these partitions as well. To circumvent this, the partition or volume must be formatted explicitly by using the Format tool. No. The Disk and Partition GUIDs will no longer be unique. This must never happen. You can make a sector-by-sector copy of the contents of Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition or basic data partitions. Yes; however, there are some key caveats. The OEM Preinstallation Kit (OPK) initializes the Disk and Partition GUIDs to zero. On first boot of Windows XP, the operating system generates unique GUIDs. The OPK only supports generation of Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition, Microsoft Reserved Partition, and basic data partitions. If a program has recorded any Disk or Partition GUIDs, the program may not work. Any programs, drivers, utilities, or firmware implementations that are supplied by computer manufacturers or program vendors that rely on GUIDs should be capable of handling GUIDs that change from the OPK initialization values to those that are generated by the operating system. It is a way for OEMs to simplify operating system pre-installation and system recovery. This command can easily be extended to create a default disk configuration for the platform. For example, the computer manufacturer could extend the MAKE command to automatically partition the boot drive with an Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition, Microsoft Reserved Partition, an OEM-specific partition, and one basic data partition. For example, consider a possible disk configuration called BOOT_DISK. In the event of disaster recovery, MAKE BOOT_DISK would allow the customer to completely repartition a boot disk to the original factory defaults. Windows XP will generate new GUIDs for any duplicate Disk GUID, Microsoft Reserved Partition GUID, or Microsoft Reserved Partition basic data GUID upon detection. This is similar to the duplicate MBR signature handling in Windows 2000. Duplicate GUIDs on a dynamic container or database partition cause unpredictable results. This depends on the cluster size that is selected at the time of formatting. NTFS is currently limited to 2^32-1 allocation units. This yields a 256TB volume, using 64k clusters. However, this has only been tested to 16TB, or 17,592,186,040,320 bytes, using 4K cluster size. The following chart shows the NTFS limits based on cluster size: For example, to format a volume that has a cluster size of 8 KB, you would use a command such as the following from a command prompt, where/a: ####specifies the number of bytes per cluster: If you choose a cluster size that is too small for the size of the partition, you receive the following error message when you try to format the partition: The format operation did not complete because the cluster count is higher than expected To determine the cluster size of a volume, run the following command at a command prompt, and then note theBytes Per Clustervalue: Note The <volume> placeholder represents the volume letter. For example, when you run thefsutil fsinfo ntfsinfo c:command, you may receive results that resemble the following output: NTFS Volume Serial Number : 0xf4300f6c300f3560Version : 3.1Number Sectors : 0x000000001d17dbeeTotal Clusters : 0x0000000003a2fb7dFree Clusters : 0x000000000102bfa0Total Reserved : 0x0000000000000800Bytes Per Sector : 512Bytes Per Cluster : 4096Bytes Per FileRecord Segment : 1024Clusters Per FileRecord Segment : 0Mft Valid Data Length : 0x000000000e630000Mft Start Lcn : 0x00000000000c0000Mft2 Start Lcn : 0x0000000001d17dbeMft Zone Start : 0x00000000002185a0Mft Zone End : 0x0000000000218740RM Identifier : 1587CC47-A713-11DB-9287-806E6F6E6963 Note In this example, theBytes Per Clustervalue is 4096.

Restore time is a function of the data size, the amount of log backup that needs to be replayed, and the number of partitions that need to be restored. Restoring 1 terabyte of data typically takes 30 to 90 minutes. The restore might not happen, depending on whether key resources like databases or containers existed at that time. You can verify by entering the time and looking at a selected database or container for that time. If that is no resources exist to restore, the restore process doesn't work.

Let's say that Sam is creating a CI/CD pipeline (Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery) and wants to test it first on a local machine (laptop) before deploying it to the cloud. Sam can enable WSL (& WSL 2 to improve speed and performance), and then use a genuine Linux Ubuntu instance locally (on the laptop) with whatever Bash commands and tools they prefer. Once the development pipeline is verified locally, Sam can then push that CI/CD pipeline up to the cloud (i.e. Azure) by making it into a Docker container and pushing the container to a cloud instance where it runs on a production-ready Ubuntu VM. Bashis a popular text-based shell and command-language. It is the default shell included within Ubuntu and other Linux distros. Users type commands into a shell to execute scripts and/or run commands and tools to accomplish many tasks. Check out this article on the Windows Command Line blog:A Deep Dive Into How WSL Allows Windows to Access Linux Fileswhich goes into detail about the underlying technology. WSL requires fewer resources (CPU, memory, and storage) than a full virtual machine. WSL also allows you to run Linux command-line tools and apps alongside your Windows command-line, desktop and store apps, and to access your Windows files from within Linux. This enables you to use Windows apps and Linux command-line tools on the same set of files if you wish. Some cross-platform tools were built assuming that the environment in which they run behaves like Linux. For example, some tools assume that they are able to access very long file paths or that specific files/folders exist. This often causes problems on Windows which often behaves differently from Linux. Many languages like Ruby and Node.js are often ported to, and run great, on Windows. However, not all of the Ruby Gem or node/NPM library owners port their libraries to support Windows, and many have Linux-specific dependencies. This can often result in systems built using such tools and libraries suffering from build and sometimes runtime errors or unwanted behaviors on Windows. These are just some of issues that caused many people to ask Microsoft to improve Windowsâ€™ command-line tools and what drove us to partner with Canonical to enable native Bash and Linux command-line tools to run on Windows. While working with OSS projects, there are numerous scenarios where itâ€™s immensely useful to drop into Bash from a PowerShell prompt. Bash support is complementary and strengthens the value of the command-line on Windows, allowing PowerShell and the PowerShell community to leverage other popular technologies. Read more on the PowerShell team blog --Bash for Windows: Why itâ€™s awesome and what it means for PowerShell WSL supports x64 and Arm CPUs. Mount points for hard drives on the local machine are automatically created and provide easy access to the Windows file system. /mnt/<drive letter>/ Example usage would becd /mnt/cto access c:\ See the tutorialGet started using Git on Windows Subsystem for Linux, which features a section on setting up Git Credential Manager and storing authentication tokens in Windows Credential Manager. One of the benefits of WSL is being able to access your files via both Windows and Linux apps or tools. WSL mounts your machine's fixed drives under the/mnt/<drive>folder in your Linux distros. For example, yourC:drive is mounted under/mnt/c/. Using your mounted drives, you can edit code in, for example,C:\dev\myproj\usingVisual StudioorVS Code, and build/test that code in Linux by accessing the same files via/mnt/c/dev/myproj. Learn more inWorking across Windows and Linux file systemsarticle. Files under the Linux root (i.e./) are controlled by WSL which aligns with Linux behavior, including but not limited to: Files in mounted drives are controlled by Windows and have the following behaviors: To remove a distribution from WSL anddelete all of the data associated with that Linux distribution, runwsl --unregister <distroName>where<distroName>is the name of your Linux distro, which can be seen from the list in thewsl -lcommand. Additionally, you can then uninstall the Linux distro app on your machine just like any other store application. To learn more about wsl commands, see the article,Basic commands for WSL. OpenSSH ships with Windows as an optional feature. See theInstall OpenSSHdoc. Administrator privileges in Windows are required to run OpenSSH in WSL. To run an OpenSSH server, run your WSL distribution (i.e. Ubuntu) or Windows Terminal as an administrator. There are several resources out there covering SSH scenarios with WSL. Check out Scott Hanselman's blog articles:How to SSH into a Windows 10 Machine from Linux OR Windows OR anywhere,How to SSH into WSL2 on Windows 10 from an external machine,THE EASY WAY how to SSH into Bash and WSL2 on Windows 10 from an external machine, andHow to use Windows 10's built-in OpenSSH to automatically SSH into a remote Linux machine. WSL install will try to automatically change the Ubuntu locale to match the locale of your Windows install. If you do not want this behavior you can run this command to change the Ubuntu locale after install completes. You will have to relaunch your WSL distribution for this change to take effect. The below example changes the locale to en-US: Some users have reported issues with specific firewall applications blocking internet access in WSL. The firewalls reported are: In some cases turning off the firewall allows for access. In some cases simply having the firewall installed looks to block access. WSL shares the IP address of Windows, as it is running on Windows. As such you can access any ports on localhost e.g. if you had web content on port 1234 you could https://localhost:1234 into your Windows browser.

You can export your entire distribution to a tarball using thewsl --exportcommand. You can then import this distribution back into WSL using thewsl --importcommand, which can name a new drive location for the import, allowing you to backup and save states of (or move) your WSL distributions. To learn more about moving your WSL distributions, seeHow can I transfer my WSL files from one machine to another?. Traditional backup services that backup files in your AppData folders (like Windows Backup) will not corrupt your Linux files. Yes, however WSL has been designed and built to use with inner loop development workflows. There are design features in WSL that make it great for this purpose but may make it challenging for production-related scenarios compared to other products. Our goal is to make clear how WSL differs from a regular VM environment, so you can make the decision on whether it fits your business needs. The main differences between WSL and a traditional production environment are: There are a few ways you can accomplish this task: You can do this using PowerShell. Below are the necessary commands and explanations for each step. Please open a PowerShell window and adjust the values in between the<tags to fit your specific use case: Yes. WSL 2 is available on all Desktop SKUs where WSL is available, including Windows 10 Home and Windows 11 Home. Specifically, WSL2 requires two features to be enabled: The newest version of WSL uses asubsetof Hyper-V architecture to enable its virtualization. This subset is provided as an optional component named ""Virtual Machine Platform,"" available on all Desktop SKUs. We currently have no plans to deprecate WSL 1. You can run WSL 1 and WSL 2 distros side by side, and can upgrade and downgrade any distro at any time. Adding WSL 2 as a new architecture presents a better platform for the WSL team to deliver features that make WSL an amazing way to run a Linux environment in Windows. Some 3rd party applications cannot work when Hyper-V is in use, which means they will not be able to run when WSL 2 is enabled, such as VMware and VirtualBox. However, recently both VirtualBox and VMware have released versions that support Hyper-V and WSL2. Learn more aboutVirtualBox's changes hereandVMware's changes here. For troubleshooting issues, take a look at theVirtualBox issue discussions in the WSL repo on GitHub. StackOverflow also offers a helpful tip:How to get VirtualBox 6.0 and WSL working at the same time. We are consistently working on solutions to support third-party integration of Hyper-V. For example, we expose a set of APIs calledHypervisor Platformthat third-party virtualization providers can use to make their software compatible with Hyper-V. This lets applications use the Hyper-V architecture for their emulation such asthe Google Android Emulator, and VirtualBox 6 and above which are both now compatible with Hyper-V. See the WSL issues repo for more background and discussion onWSL 2 issues with VirtualBox 6.1. *If you're looking for a Windows virtual machine, VMWare, Hyper-V, VirtualBox, and Parallels VM downloads areavailable on the Windows Dev Center. We have released support for accessing the GPU inside of WSL 2 distributions! This means you can now use WSL for machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data science scenarios more easily when big data sets are involved. Check out theget started with GPU supporttutorial. As of right now WSL 2 does not include serial support, or USB device support. We are investigating the best way to add these features. However, USB support is now available through the USBIPD-WIN project. SeeConnect USB devicesfor steps to set up USB device support. Yes, in general networking applications will work better and be faster with WSL 2 since it offers full system call compatibility. However, the WSL 2 architecture uses virtualized networking components, which means that WSL 2 will behave similarly to a virtual machine -- WSL 2 distributions will have a different IP address than the host machine (Windows OS). For more information, seeAccessing network applications with WSL. Yes! You need to make sure that the virtual machine has nested virtualization enabled. This can be enabled in your parent Hyper-V host by running the following command in a PowerShell window with Administrator privileges: Set-VMProcessor -VMName <VMName> -ExposeVirtualizationExtensions $true Make sure to replace '<VMName>' with the name of your virtual machine. WSL 2 supports the same wsl.conf file that WSL 1 uses. This means that any configuration options that you had set in a WSL 1 distro, such as automounting Windows drives, enabling or disabling interop, changing the directory where Windows drives will be mounted, etc. will all work inside of WSL 2. You can learn more about the configuration options in WSL in theDistribution Managementpage.

What is dependency/impact on 32-bit vs. 64-bit OS going from Legacy boot to UEFI and vice versa if the firmware is 64-bit UEFI or 32-bit UEFI?,"One limitation of Windows UEFI boot is that you can only boot an OS ""bitness"" that matches the UEFI that is installed (see Question 7). If you have a 32-bit UEFI, you can only install a 32-bit Windows on it. 64-bit Windows requires 64-bit UEFI or a CSM. However, if a system is missing a CSM, you cannot boot Win7 64-bit Windows OS.","This article provides a list of frequently asked questions about the GUID Partition Table disk architecture. Applies to:Windows Server 2012 R2Original KB number:302873 Important This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, seeHow to back up and restore the registry in Windows. The GUID Partition Table disk architecture was introduced as part of the Extensible Firmware Interface initiative. GUID Partition Table is a new disk architecture that expands on the older Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning scheme that has been common to Intel-based computers. A partition is a contiguous space of storage on a physical or logical disk that functions as though it were a physically separate disk. Partitions are visible to the system firmware and the installed operating systems. Access to a partition is controlled by the system firmware and the operating system that is currently active. GUID Partition Table disks can grow to a large size. As of July 2001, the Microsoft implementation supports a hard disk of up to 18 EB (512 KB LBAs). The number of partitions on a GUID Partition Table disk is not constrained by temporary schemes such as container partitions as defined by the MBR Extended Boot Record. The Microsoft implementation of GUID Partition Table is limited to 128 partitions. However, it is important to note that one partition is used for the EFI System Partition, one for the Microsoft Reserved and two more are used if you use dynamic disks. This leaves 124 partitions for data use. The GUID Partition Table disk partition format is well defined and fully self-identifying. Data that is critical to the operating system is located in partitions and not in unpartitioned orhiddensectors. GUID Partition Table does not allow for hidden sectors or partitions. GUID Partition Table disks use primary and backup partition tables for redundancy and CRC32 fields for improved partition data structure integrity. The GUID Partition Table partition format uses version number and size fields for future expansion. Each GUID Partition Table partition has a unique identification GUID and a partition content type, so no coordination is necessary to prevent partition identifier collision. Each GUID Partition Table partition has a 36-character Unicode name, which means that any software can present an easily readable name for the partition without any additional understanding of the partition. MBR disks support only four primary partitions table entries or multiple logical partitions in the extended partition. If more partitions are wanted, a secondary structure, an extended partition, is necessary. Extended partitions are then subdivided into one or more logical disks. Only one extended partition can be present on any given drive, and the maximum number of logical drives is MAXULONG/4. All MBR disk partitions and logical drives must be cylinder-aligned, even on hardware RAID sets that are built from multiple different drives with no clear underlying physical geometry. MBR partitioning rules are complex and poorly specified. For example, does cylinder alignment mean that each partition must be at least one cylinder in length? An MBR partition is identified by a two-byte field, and coordination is necessary to avoid collision. IBM originally provided that coordination, but as of July 2001, there is no single authoritative list of partition identifiers. Another common practice is to use partitioned or ""hidden"" sectors to hold specific information. That practice is undocumented and results in severe system problems that are difficult to debug. Over the years, broken implementations and tools have been released to the public, making support difficult. Chapter 16 of the Extensible Firmware Interface specification defines the GUID Partition Table format. This document is available at the following Intel Web site: The Unified EFI Specification Defines an Interface Between an Operating System and Platform Firmware Third-party information disclaimer The third-party products that this article discusses are manufactured by companies that are independent of Microsoft. Microsoft makes no warranty, implied or otherwise, about the performance or reliability of these products. No. GUID Partition Table disks are self-identifying. All the information that is needed to interpret the partitioning scheme of a GUID Partition Table disk is completely contained in structures in specified locations on the physical media. In theory, a GUID Partition Table disk can be up to 264 sectors in a single logical block in length. Logical blocks are commonly 512 bytes or one sector in size. In practice, Windows XP supports GUID Partition Table disks of up to approximately 18 exabytes in size. In theory, an unlimited number. As the July 2001, the Microsoft implementation is 128 partitions. The number of partitions is limited by the amount of space that is reserved for making partition entries. No. However, all GUID Partition Table disks contain a protective MBR that is used for legacy programs that do not understand the GUID Partition Table disk structure. The Protective MBR, beginning in sector 0, precedes the GUID Partition Table partition table on the disk. The MBR contains one type 0xEE partition that spans the entire length of the disk. This is the same regardless of the number of partitions that are defined in the GUID Partition Table disk entry array. The Protective MBR protects GUID Partition Table disks from previously-released MBR disk tools such as Microsoft MS-DOS FDISK or Microsoft Windows NT Disk Administrator. These tools are not aware of GUID Partition Table and do not know how to properly access a GUID Partition Table disk. Legacy software that does not know about GUID Partition Table interprets only the Protected MBR when it accesses a GUID Partition Table disk. These tools will view a GUID Partition Table disk as having a single encompassing (possibly unrecognized) partition by interpreting the Protected MBR, rather than mistaking the disk for one that is unpartitioned. If this occurred, you must have used an MBR-only-aware disk tool to access the GUID Partition Table disk. The EE partition in the Protective MBR is specified to be the maximum size that is allowable in an MBR. Can the 64-bit version of Windows XP read, write, and boot from GUID Partition Table disks? The 64-bit version of Windows XP can read and write GUID Partition Table disks, but cannot boot from GUID Partition Table disks. Can the 64-bit version of Windows XP read, write, and boot from MBR disks? Yes. Can the 32-bit version of Windows XP read, write, and boot from GUID Partition Table disks? No. The 32-bit version will see only the Protective MBR. The EE partition will not be mounted or otherwise exposed to program software. Can the 32-bit version of Windows XP read, write, and boot from MBR disks? Yes. Can Microsoft Windows 2000, Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, or Microsoft Windows 98/95 read, write, and boot from GUID Partition Table? No. Legacy software will see only the Protective MBR. GUID Partition Table and MBR disks can be mixed only on 64-bit systems, and the following restrictions apply: The Windows XP loader and the boot partition must reside on a GUID Partition Table disk. Other hard disks can be either MBR or GUID Partition Table. Both MBR and GUID Partition Table disks can be present in a single dynamic disk group. Volume sets can span both MBR and GUID Partition Table disks, however, the MBR cylinder alignment restriction might cause some difficulties with mirroring or striping MBR and GUID Partition Table disks. Removable media must be MBR orsuperfloppy. Removable media without either GUID Partition Table or MBR formatting is considered a superfloppy. The entire media is treated as a single partition. The media manufacturer performs any MBR partitioning of removable media; Windows never partitions removable media. If the media does have an MBR, only one partition is supported. There is little user-discernible difference between MBR-partitioned media and superfloppies. Examples of removable media include floppy disks, JAZZ disk cartridges, magneto-optical media, DVD-ROM, and CD-ROM. Hard disk drives on external buses such as SCSI or IEEE 1394 are not considered removable. What is the default behavior of the 64-bit version of Windows XP when partitioning media? Fixed disks are partitioned by using GUID Partition Table partitioning. GUID Partition Table disks can be converted to MBR disks only if all existing partitioning is first deleted, with associated loss of data. What is the default behavior of the 32-bit version of Windows XP when partitioning media? Only MBR disks can be used. MBR disks cannot be converted to GUID Partition Table disks. How can a drive letter in the operating system be mapped to a partition in Extensible Firmware Interface Firmware? There is no inherent mapping between drive letter and partition that can be used to determine one from the other. A basic data partition must be identified by its partition GUID. How can an Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition be created? Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions can be created by using the Extensible Firmware Interface firmware utility Diskpart.efi or the Windows XP command-line utility Diskpart.exe, or they can be created programmatically by using IOCTL_SET_DRIVE_LAYOUT . You should not change any partition header entry directly. Do not use disk tools or utilities to make alterations or changes. Detachable disks are commonly expected to migrate between computers or simply to be unavailable to the operating system at times. Examples of detachable disks are IEEE 1394 disks, which can be easily disconnected by the end user, or Microsoft Cluster Services (MSCS) shared disks, which move between nodes in a cluster. Windows XP supports only MBR partitioning on detachable disks. What is the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition? The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition contains the NTLDR, Boot.ini, and other files that are necessary to boot the computer, such as drivers. The Partition GUID defines the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition: DEFINE_GUID (PARTITION_SYSTEM_GUID, 0xC12A7328L, 0xF81F, 0x11D2, 0xBA, 0x4B, 0x00, 0xA0, 0xC9, 0x3E, 0xC9, 0x3B) Do only GUID Partition Table disks have Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions? No, MBR disks can also have Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions. Extensible Firmware Interface specifies booting from either GUID Partition Table or MBR. The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions on an MBR disk is identified by partition type 0xEF. However, Windows XP does not support booting Extensible Firmware Interface from MBR disks or 0xEF partitions. How big is the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition? The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is determined by using the following algorithm: Max (100MB, min (1 percent of physical disk, 1GB)) In other words, the size of the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition must be the larger of these two numbers, 100 MB or 1 percent of the physical disk size (up to 1 GB). The physical disk size is measured at the time of disk partitioning. The value 1 percent of the physical disk is calculated at the time that the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is created and does not change if the disk is extended later (for example, by using RAID). Can there be two Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions on a single disk? Such a configuration should not be created and will not be supported. What about two Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions on two different disks? Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions can be replicated for high-availability configurations. Replication must be done manually and the contents must be synchronized manually. Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions cannot be mirrored. What does Microsoft place in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition? Microsoft places the loader, and other files that are necessary to boot the operating system in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. Where should the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition be placed on the disk? The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition must be first on the disk. While there is no architectural requirement, there are numerous reasons why it is beneficial to place the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition first. The primary reason for this is that it is impossible to span volumes when the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is logically between the two data partitions you are attempting to span. What should a computer or device manufacturer place in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition? The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition should only include files that are required for booting an operating system, platform tools that run before operating system boot, or files that must be accessed before operating system boot, for example in performing pre-boot system maintenance. Other value-added files or diagnostics that are used while the operating system is running should not be placed in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. It is important to note that the space in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is a limited system resource; its primary purpose is to provide storage for the files that are necessary to boot the operating system. The preferred option is for computer manufacturers to place value-added contents in an OEM-specific partition. Just like MBR OEM partitions, the contents of GUID Partition Table OEM (or other unrecognized) partitions are not exposed (given drive letters or returned in volume lists). Users are warned that deleting the partition can cause the computer to fail to operate. An OEM-specific partition should be placed before the Microsoft Reserved Partition and after any Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition on the disk. Although not architectural, this placement has the same benefits as placing the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition first. For example, it is also impossible to span volumes when an OEM-specific partition is logically between the two data partitions you are attempting to span. Placement in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is an option for programs or files that run in the pre-operating system boot environment. However, the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is architecturally-shared space and represents a limited resource. Consuming space in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition should be considered carefully. Files that are not relevant to the pre-operating system boot environment should not be placed in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. What is a Microsoft Reserved Partition? The Microsoft Reserved Partition reserves space on each disk drive for subsequent use by operating system software. GUID Partition Table disks do not allow hidden sectors. Software components that formerly used hidden sectors now allocate portions of the Microsoft Reserved Partition for component-specific partitions. For example, converting a basic disk to a dynamic disk causes the Microsoft Reserved Partition on that disk to be reduced in size and a newly created partition holds the dynamic disk database. The Microsoft Reserved Partition has the following Partition GUID: DEFINE_GUID (PARTITION_MSFT_RESERVED_GUID, 0xE3C9E316L, 0x0B5C, 0x4DB8, 0x81, 0x7D, 0xF9, 0x2D, 0xF0, 0x02, 0x15, 0xAE What disks require a Microsoft Reserved Partition? Every GUID Partition Table disk must contain a Microsoft Reserved Partition. The Microsoft Reserved Partition must be the first partition after the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition (if any) on the disk. It is particularly important that the Microsoft Reserved Partition be created before other primary data partitions. Who creates the Microsoft Reserved Partition? The Microsoft Reserved Partition must be created when disk-partitioning information is first written to the drive. If the manufacturer partitions the disk, the manufacturer must create the Microsoft Reserved Partition at the same time. If Windows partitions the disk during Setup, it creates the Microsoft Reserved Partition. Why must the Microsoft Reserved Partition be created when the disk is first partitioned? After the disk is partitioned, there will be no free space left to create a Microsoft Reserved Partition. How big is the Microsoft Reserved Partition? When initially created, the size of the Microsoft Reserved Partition depends on the size of the disk drive: Each bootable drive must contain an Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition, a Microsoft Reserved Partition, and at least one basic data partition that contains the operating system. Each data drive must contain at least a Microsoft Reserved Partition and one basic data partition. All basic data partitions on the drive should be contiguous. As previously noted, placing an OEM-specific or other unrecognized partition between data partitions imposes limitations on later volume spanning Basic data partitions correspond to primary MBR partitions 0x6 (FAT), 0x7 (NTFS), or 0xB (FAT32). There is a direct one-to-one correlation between a basic data partition and a drive letter or mount point, other volume device object, or both. Each basic data partition is represented in Windows as a volume device object, and optionally as a mount point or a drive letter. It has the following partition type GUID: DEFINE_GUID (PARTITION_BASIC_DATA_GUID, 0xEBD0A0A2L, 0xB9E5, 0x4433, 0x87, 0xC0, 0x68, 0xB6, 0xB7, 0x26, 0x99, 0xC7) The user won't see these partitions exposed in Windows Explorer, nor is any recognized file system exposed to legacy programs such as Context Indexing. The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition, OEM-specific, and other unrecognized partitions will be visible only in the Disk Management MMC snap-in. Windows XP exposes only basic data partitions. Other partitions with FAT file systems may be mounted, but not exposed (only programmatically). Only basic data partitions are assigned drive letters or mount points. The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition FAT file system is mounted, but not exposed. This allows programs running under Windows to update the contents of the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. The following registry key locates the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/System/Setup/SystemPartition The Microsoft Reserved Partition (and any partitions that are created from the Microsoft Reserved Partition) could have recognizable file systems; none are exposed. Any OEM-specific partitions or partitions that are associated with other operating systems are not recognized by Windows. Unrecognized partitions with recognizable file systems are treated like the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. They will be mounted, but not exposed. Unlike MBR disks, there is no practical difference between OEM-specific partitions and other operating system partitions; all are unrecognized. The user can use disk management tools such as the Disk Management MMC snap-in or Diskpart.exe. The Microsoft Reserved Partition and any partitions that are created from the Microsoft Reserved Partition are only visible from a command prompt. Dynamic disks use two different GUID Partition Table partitions: A data container partition corresponding to the MBR partition 0x42, with the following GUID:DEFINE_GUID (PARTITION_LDM_DATA_GUID, 0xAF9B60A0L, 0x1431, 0x4F62, 0xBC, 0x68, 0x33, 0x11, 0x71, 0x4A, 0x69, 0xAD) A partition to contain the dynamic configuration database, with the following GUID:DEFINE_GUID(PARTITION_LDM_METADATA_GUID, 0x5808C8AAL, 0x7E8F, 0x42E0, 0x85, 0xD2, 0xE1, 0xE9, 0x04, 0x34, 0xCF, 0xB3)
Volumes are created in the data container and are mounted by default. This is the same as the contents of 0x42 MBR partitions. For a drive to be eligible for conversion to dynamic, all basic data partitions on the drive must be contiguous. If other unrecognized partitions separate basic data partitions, the disk cannot be converted. This is one of the reasons that the Microsoft Reserved Partition must be created before any basic data partitions. The first step in conversion is to separate a portion of the Microsoft Reserved Partition to create the configuration database partition. All non-bootable basic partitions are then combined into a single data container partition. Boot partitions are retained as separate data container partitions. This is analogous to conversion of primary partitions. Windows XP differs from Windows 2000 in that basic and extended partitions are preferentially converted to a single 0x42 partition, rather than being retained as multiple distinct 0x42 partitions as on Windows 2000. You can access the GUID Partition Table disk partitions of different types by using the following tools. Diskpart.efi:Firmware: Extensible Firmware Interface System PartitionMicrosoft Reserved Partition Diskpart.exe:Windows XP: Extensible Firmware Interface System PartitionMicrosoft Reserved Partition Diskgmt.msc:Windows XP: Extensible Firmware Interface System PartitionDATA Explorer.exe:Windows XP: DATA You can also develop your own tools (by using the Microsoft Win32 or Microsoft Win64 APIs) to access the GUID Partition Table disk partitions at their primitive levels. GUID Partition Table and MBR disks are managed the same way. Disks can be formatted as GUID Partition Table or MBR by using the Diskpart.exe command-line utility or by using the Disk Management snap-in. Volumes can be created on both GUID Partition Table and MBR disks, and both kinds of disks can be mixed in the same dynamic disk group. There is no FTdisk set support on Windows XP for MBR or GUID Partition Table disks. The only support for logical volumes is through dynamic disks. Yes, but only if the disk contains no partitions or volumes. Any data on the disk will be destroyed. GUID Partition Table disks are only supported on the 64-bit version of Windows XP. NTFS is recommended on all basic data partitions and all dynamic volumes. Windows Setup and the Disk Management snap-in offer only NTFS. However, you can still use FAT16 and FAT32 on these partitions as well. To circumvent this, the partition or volume must be formatted explicitly by using the Format tool. No. The Disk and Partition GUIDs will no longer be unique. This must never happen. You can make a sector-by-sector copy of the contents of Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition or basic data partitions. Yes; however, there are some key caveats. The OEM Preinstallation Kit (OPK) initializes the Disk and Partition GUIDs to zero. On first boot of Windows XP, the operating system generates unique GUIDs. The OPK only supports generation of Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition, Microsoft Reserved Partition, and basic data partitions. If a program has recorded any Disk or Partition GUIDs, the program may not work. Any programs, drivers, utilities, or firmware implementations that are supplied by computer manufacturers or program vendors that rely on GUIDs should be capable of handling GUIDs that change from the OPK initialization values to those that are generated by the operating system. It is a way for OEMs to simplify operating system pre-installation and system recovery. This command can easily be extended to create a default disk configuration for the platform. For example, the computer manufacturer could extend the MAKE command to automatically partition the boot drive with an Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition, Microsoft Reserved Partition, an OEM-specific partition, and one basic data partition. For example, consider a possible disk configuration called BOOT_DISK. In the event of disaster recovery, MAKE BOOT_DISK would allow the customer to completely repartition a boot disk to the original factory defaults. Windows XP will generate new GUIDs for any duplicate Disk GUID, Microsoft Reserved Partition GUID, or Microsoft Reserved Partition basic data GUID upon detection. This is similar to the duplicate MBR signature handling in Windows 2000. Duplicate GUIDs on a dynamic container or database partition cause unpredictable results. This depends on the cluster size that is selected at the time of formatting. NTFS is currently limited to 2^32-1 allocation units. This yields a 256TB volume, using 64k clusters. However, this has only been tested to 16TB, or 17,592,186,040,320 bytes, using 4K cluster size. The following chart shows the NTFS limits based on cluster size: For example, to format a volume that has a cluster size of 8 KB, you would use a command such as the following from a command prompt, where/a: ####specifies the number of bytes per cluster: If you choose a cluster size that is too small for the size of the partition, you receive the following error message when you try to format the partition: The format operation did not complete because the cluster count is higher than expected To determine the cluster size of a volume, run the following command at a command prompt, and then note theBytes Per Clustervalue: Note The <volume> placeholder represents the volume letter.

Can you convert a system booting using Legacy MBR boot to GPT boot on the fly without impacting data?,No. Using Microsoft tools such as diskpart.exe will result in data loss. MBR boot and GPT boot are two different booting mechanisms that require a change to the disk that will remove all data from the disk in order to implement this change. Backup any data prior to attempting to make this change.,"This article provides a list of frequently asked questions about the GUID Partition Table disk architecture. Applies to:Windows Server 2012 R2Original KB number:302873 Important This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, seeHow to back up and restore the registry in Windows. The GUID Partition Table disk architecture was introduced as part of the Extensible Firmware Interface initiative. GUID Partition Table is a new disk architecture that expands on the older Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning scheme that has been common to Intel-based computers. A partition is a contiguous space of storage on a physical or logical disk that functions as though it were a physically separate disk. Partitions are visible to the system firmware and the installed operating systems. Access to a partition is controlled by the system firmware and the operating system that is currently active. GUID Partition Table disks can grow to a large size. As of July 2001, the Microsoft implementation supports a hard disk of up to 18 EB (512 KB LBAs). The number of partitions on a GUID Partition Table disk is not constrained by temporary schemes such as container partitions as defined by the MBR Extended Boot Record. The Microsoft implementation of GUID Partition Table is limited to 128 partitions. However, it is important to note that one partition is used for the EFI System Partition, one for the Microsoft Reserved and two more are used if you use dynamic disks. This leaves 124 partitions for data use. The GUID Partition Table disk partition format is well defined and fully self-identifying. Data that is critical to the operating system is located in partitions and not in unpartitioned orhiddensectors. GUID Partition Table does not allow for hidden sectors or partitions. GUID Partition Table disks use primary and backup partition tables for redundancy and CRC32 fields for improved partition data structure integrity. The GUID Partition Table partition format uses version number and size fields for future expansion. Each GUID Partition Table partition has a unique identification GUID and a partition content type, so no coordination is necessary to prevent partition identifier collision. Each GUID Partition Table partition has a 36-character Unicode name, which means that any software can present an easily readable name for the partition without any additional understanding of the partition. MBR disks support only four primary partitions table entries or multiple logical partitions in the extended partition. If more partitions are wanted, a secondary structure, an extended partition, is necessary. Extended partitions are then subdivided into one or more logical disks. Only one extended partition can be present on any given drive, and the maximum number of logical drives is MAXULONG/4. All MBR disk partitions and logical drives must be cylinder-aligned, even on hardware RAID sets that are built from multiple different drives with no clear underlying physical geometry. MBR partitioning rules are complex and poorly specified. For example, does cylinder alignment mean that each partition must be at least one cylinder in length? An MBR partition is identified by a two-byte field, and coordination is necessary to avoid collision. IBM originally provided that coordination, but as of July 2001, there is no single authoritative list of partition identifiers. Another common practice is to use partitioned or ""hidden"" sectors to hold specific information. That practice is undocumented and results in severe system problems that are difficult to debug. Over the years, broken implementations and tools have been released to the public, making support difficult. Chapter 16 of the Extensible Firmware Interface specification defines the GUID Partition Table format. This document is available at the following Intel Web site: The Unified EFI Specification Defines an Interface Between an Operating System and Platform Firmware Third-party information disclaimer The third-party products that this article discusses are manufactured by companies that are independent of Microsoft. Microsoft makes no warranty, implied or otherwise, about the performance or reliability of these products. No. GUID Partition Table disks are self-identifying. All the information that is needed to interpret the partitioning scheme of a GUID Partition Table disk is completely contained in structures in specified locations on the physical media. In theory, a GUID Partition Table disk can be up to 264 sectors in a single logical block in length. Logical blocks are commonly 512 bytes or one sector in size. In practice, Windows XP supports GUID Partition Table disks of up to approximately 18 exabytes in size. In theory, an unlimited number. As the July 2001, the Microsoft implementation is 128 partitions. The number of partitions is limited by the amount of space that is reserved for making partition entries. No. However, all GUID Partition Table disks contain a protective MBR that is used for legacy programs that do not understand the GUID Partition Table disk structure. The Protective MBR, beginning in sector 0, precedes the GUID Partition Table partition table on the disk. The MBR contains one type 0xEE partition that spans the entire length of the disk. This is the same regardless of the number of partitions that are defined in the GUID Partition Table disk entry array. The Protective MBR protects GUID Partition Table disks from previously-released MBR disk tools such as Microsoft MS-DOS FDISK or Microsoft Windows NT Disk Administrator. These tools are not aware of GUID Partition Table and do not know how to properly access a GUID Partition Table disk. Legacy software that does not know about GUID Partition Table interprets only the Protected MBR when it accesses a GUID Partition Table disk. These tools will view a GUID Partition Table disk as having a single encompassing (possibly unrecognized) partition by interpreting the Protected MBR, rather than mistaking the disk for one that is unpartitioned. If this occurred, you must have used an MBR-only-aware disk tool to access the GUID Partition Table disk. The EE partition in the Protective MBR is specified to be the maximum size that is allowable in an MBR. Can the 64-bit version of Windows XP read, write, and boot from GUID Partition Table disks? The 64-bit version of Windows XP can read and write GUID Partition Table disks, but cannot boot from GUID Partition Table disks. Can the 64-bit version of Windows XP read, write, and boot from MBR disks? Yes. Can the 32-bit version of Windows XP read, write, and boot from GUID Partition Table disks? No. The 32-bit version will see only the Protective MBR. The EE partition will not be mounted or otherwise exposed to program software. Can the 32-bit version of Windows XP read, write, and boot from MBR disks? Yes. Can Microsoft Windows 2000, Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, or Microsoft Windows 98/95 read, write, and boot from GUID Partition Table? No. Legacy software will see only the Protective MBR. GUID Partition Table and MBR disks can be mixed only on 64-bit systems, and the following restrictions apply: The Windows XP loader and the boot partition must reside on a GUID Partition Table disk. Other hard disks can be either MBR or GUID Partition Table. Both MBR and GUID Partition Table disks can be present in a single dynamic disk group. Volume sets can span both MBR and GUID Partition Table disks, however, the MBR cylinder alignment restriction might cause some difficulties with mirroring or striping MBR and GUID Partition Table disks. Removable media must be MBR orsuperfloppy. Removable media without either GUID Partition Table or MBR formatting is considered a superfloppy. The entire media is treated as a single partition. The media manufacturer performs any MBR partitioning of removable media; Windows never partitions removable media. If the media does have an MBR, only one partition is supported. There is little user-discernible difference between MBR-partitioned media and superfloppies. Examples of removable media include floppy disks, JAZZ disk cartridges, magneto-optical media, DVD-ROM, and CD-ROM. Hard disk drives on external buses such as SCSI or IEEE 1394 are not considered removable. What is the default behavior of the 64-bit version of Windows XP when partitioning media? Fixed disks are partitioned by using GUID Partition Table partitioning. GUID Partition Table disks can be converted to MBR disks only if all existing partitioning is first deleted, with associated loss of data. What is the default behavior of the 32-bit version of Windows XP when partitioning media? Only MBR disks can be used. MBR disks cannot be converted to GUID Partition Table disks. How can a drive letter in the operating system be mapped to a partition in Extensible Firmware Interface Firmware? There is no inherent mapping between drive letter and partition that can be used to determine one from the other. A basic data partition must be identified by its partition GUID. How can an Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition be created? Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions can be created by using the Extensible Firmware Interface firmware utility Diskpart.efi or the Windows XP command-line utility Diskpart.exe, or they can be created programmatically by using IOCTL_SET_DRIVE_LAYOUT . You should not change any partition header entry directly. Do not use disk tools or utilities to make alterations or changes. Detachable disks are commonly expected to migrate between computers or simply to be unavailable to the operating system at times. Examples of detachable disks are IEEE 1394 disks, which can be easily disconnected by the end user, or Microsoft Cluster Services (MSCS) shared disks, which move between nodes in a cluster. Windows XP supports only MBR partitioning on detachable disks. What is the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition? The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition contains the NTLDR, Boot.ini, and other files that are necessary to boot the computer, such as drivers. The Partition GUID defines the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition: DEFINE_GUID (PARTITION_SYSTEM_GUID, 0xC12A7328L, 0xF81F, 0x11D2, 0xBA, 0x4B, 0x00, 0xA0, 0xC9, 0x3E, 0xC9, 0x3B) Do only GUID Partition Table disks have Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions? No, MBR disks can also have Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions. Extensible Firmware Interface specifies booting from either GUID Partition Table or MBR. The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions on an MBR disk is identified by partition type 0xEF. However, Windows XP does not support booting Extensible Firmware Interface from MBR disks or 0xEF partitions. How big is the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition? The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is determined by using the following algorithm: Max (100MB, min (1 percent of physical disk, 1GB)) In other words, the size of the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition must be the larger of these two numbers, 100 MB or 1 percent of the physical disk size (up to 1 GB). The physical disk size is measured at the time of disk partitioning. The value 1 percent of the physical disk is calculated at the time that the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is created and does not change if the disk is extended later (for example, by using RAID). Can there be two Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions on a single disk? Such a configuration should not be created and will not be supported. What about two Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions on two different disks? Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions can be replicated for high-availability configurations. Replication must be done manually and the contents must be synchronized manually. Extensible Firmware Interface System Partitions cannot be mirrored. What does Microsoft place in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition? Microsoft places the loader, and other files that are necessary to boot the operating system in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. Where should the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition be placed on the disk? The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition must be first on the disk. While there is no architectural requirement, there are numerous reasons why it is beneficial to place the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition first. The primary reason for this is that it is impossible to span volumes when the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is logically between the two data partitions you are attempting to span. What should a computer or device manufacturer place in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition? The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition should only include files that are required for booting an operating system, platform tools that run before operating system boot, or files that must be accessed before operating system boot, for example in performing pre-boot system maintenance. Other value-added files or diagnostics that are used while the operating system is running should not be placed in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. It is important to note that the space in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is a limited system resource; its primary purpose is to provide storage for the files that are necessary to boot the operating system. The preferred option is for computer manufacturers to place value-added contents in an OEM-specific partition. Just like MBR OEM partitions, the contents of GUID Partition Table OEM (or other unrecognized) partitions are not exposed (given drive letters or returned in volume lists). Users are warned that deleting the partition can cause the computer to fail to operate. An OEM-specific partition should be placed before the Microsoft Reserved Partition and after any Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition on the disk. Although not architectural, this placement has the same benefits as placing the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition first. For example, it is also impossible to span volumes when an OEM-specific partition is logically between the two data partitions you are attempting to span. Placement in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is an option for programs or files that run in the pre-operating system boot environment. However, the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition is architecturally-shared space and represents a limited resource. Consuming space in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition should be considered carefully. Files that are not relevant to the pre-operating system boot environment should not be placed in the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. What is a Microsoft Reserved Partition? The Microsoft Reserved Partition reserves space on each disk drive for subsequent use by operating system software. GUID Partition Table disks do not allow hidden sectors. Software components that formerly used hidden sectors now allocate portions of the Microsoft Reserved Partition for component-specific partitions. For example, converting a basic disk to a dynamic disk causes the Microsoft Reserved Partition on that disk to be reduced in size and a newly created partition holds the dynamic disk database. The Microsoft Reserved Partition has the following Partition GUID: DEFINE_GUID (PARTITION_MSFT_RESERVED_GUID, 0xE3C9E316L, 0x0B5C, 0x4DB8, 0x81, 0x7D, 0xF9, 0x2D, 0xF0, 0x02, 0x15, 0xAE What disks require a Microsoft Reserved Partition? Every GUID Partition Table disk must contain a Microsoft Reserved Partition. The Microsoft Reserved Partition must be the first partition after the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition (if any) on the disk. It is particularly important that the Microsoft Reserved Partition be created before other primary data partitions. Who creates the Microsoft Reserved Partition? The Microsoft Reserved Partition must be created when disk-partitioning information is first written to the drive. If the manufacturer partitions the disk, the manufacturer must create the Microsoft Reserved Partition at the same time. If Windows partitions the disk during Setup, it creates the Microsoft Reserved Partition. Why must the Microsoft Reserved Partition be created when the disk is first partitioned? After the disk is partitioned, there will be no free space left to create a Microsoft Reserved Partition. How big is the Microsoft Reserved Partition? When initially created, the size of the Microsoft Reserved Partition depends on the size of the disk drive: Each bootable drive must contain an Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition, a Microsoft Reserved Partition, and at least one basic data partition that contains the operating system. Each data drive must contain at least a Microsoft Reserved Partition and one basic data partition. All basic data partitions on the drive should be contiguous. As previously noted, placing an OEM-specific or other unrecognized partition between data partitions imposes limitations on later volume spanning Basic data partitions correspond to primary MBR partitions 0x6 (FAT), 0x7 (NTFS), or 0xB (FAT32). There is a direct one-to-one correlation between a basic data partition and a drive letter or mount point, other volume device object, or both. Each basic data partition is represented in Windows as a volume device object, and optionally as a mount point or a drive letter. It has the following partition type GUID: DEFINE_GUID (PARTITION_BASIC_DATA_GUID, 0xEBD0A0A2L, 0xB9E5, 0x4433, 0x87, 0xC0, 0x68, 0xB6, 0xB7, 0x26, 0x99, 0xC7) The user won't see these partitions exposed in Windows Explorer, nor is any recognized file system exposed to legacy programs such as Context Indexing. The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition, OEM-specific, and other unrecognized partitions will be visible only in the Disk Management MMC snap-in. Windows XP exposes only basic data partitions. Other partitions with FAT file systems may be mounted, but not exposed (only programmatically). Only basic data partitions are assigned drive letters or mount points. The Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition FAT file system is mounted, but not exposed. This allows programs running under Windows to update the contents of the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. The following registry key locates the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/System/Setup/SystemPartition The Microsoft Reserved Partition (and any partitions that are created from the Microsoft Reserved Partition) could have recognizable file systems; none are exposed. Any OEM-specific partitions or partitions that are associated with other operating systems are not recognized by Windows. Unrecognized partitions with recognizable file systems are treated like the Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition. They will be mounted, but not exposed. Unlike MBR disks, there is no practical difference between OEM-specific partitions and other operating system partitions; all are unrecognized. The user can use disk management tools such as the Disk Management MMC snap-in or Diskpart.exe. The Microsoft Reserved Partition and any partitions that are created from the Microsoft Reserved Partition are only visible from a command prompt. Dynamic disks use two different GUID Partition Table partitions: A data container partition corresponding to the MBR partition 0x42, with the following GUID:DEFINE_GUID (PARTITION_LDM_DATA_GUID, 0xAF9B60A0L, 0x1431, 0x4F62, 0xBC, 0x68, 0x33, 0x11, 0x71, 0x4A, 0x69, 0xAD) A partition to contain the dynamic configuration database, with the following GUID:DEFINE_GUID(PARTITION_LDM_METADATA_GUID, 0x5808C8AAL, 0x7E8F, 0x42E0, 0x85, 0xD2, 0xE1, 0xE9, 0x04, 0x34, 0xCF, 0xB3)
Volumes are created in the data container and are mounted by default. This is the same as the contents of 0x42 MBR partitions. For a drive to be eligible for conversion to dynamic, all basic data partitions on the drive must be contiguous. If other unrecognized partitions separate basic data partitions, the disk cannot be converted. This is one of the reasons that the Microsoft Reserved Partition must be created before any basic data partitions. The first step in conversion is to separate a portion of the Microsoft Reserved Partition to create the configuration database partition. All non-bootable basic partitions are then combined into a single data container partition. Boot partitions are retained as separate data container partitions. This is analogous to conversion of primary partitions. Windows XP differs from Windows 2000 in that basic and extended partitions are preferentially converted to a single 0x42 partition, rather than being retained as multiple distinct 0x42 partitions as on Windows 2000. You can access the GUID Partition Table disk partitions of different types by using the following tools. Diskpart.efi:Firmware: Extensible Firmware Interface System PartitionMicrosoft Reserved Partition Diskpart.exe:Windows XP: Extensible Firmware Interface System PartitionMicrosoft Reserved Partition Diskgmt.msc:Windows XP: Extensible Firmware Interface System PartitionDATA Explorer.exe:Windows XP: DATA You can also develop your own tools (by using the Microsoft Win32 or Microsoft Win64 APIs) to access the GUID Partition Table disk partitions at their primitive levels. GUID Partition Table and MBR disks are managed the same way. Disks can be formatted as GUID Partition Table or MBR by using the Diskpart.exe command-line utility or by using the Disk Management snap-in. Volumes can be created on both GUID Partition Table and MBR disks, and both kinds of disks can be mixed in the same dynamic disk group. There is no FTdisk set support on Windows XP for MBR or GUID Partition Table disks. The only support for logical volumes is through dynamic disks. Yes, but only if the disk contains no partitions or volumes. Any data on the disk will be destroyed. GUID Partition Table disks are only supported on the 64-bit version of Windows XP. NTFS is recommended on all basic data partitions and all dynamic volumes. Windows Setup and the Disk Management snap-in offer only NTFS. However, you can still use FAT16 and FAT32 on these partitions as well. To circumvent this, the partition or volume must be formatted explicitly by using the Format tool. No. The Disk and Partition GUIDs will no longer be unique. This must never happen. You can make a sector-by-sector copy of the contents of Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition or basic data partitions. Yes; however, there are some key caveats. The OEM Preinstallation Kit (OPK) initializes the Disk and Partition GUIDs to zero. On first boot of Windows XP, the operating system generates unique GUIDs. The OPK only supports generation of Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition, Microsoft Reserved Partition, and basic data partitions. If a program has recorded any Disk or Partition GUIDs, the program may not work. Any programs, drivers, utilities, or firmware implementations that are supplied by computer manufacturers or program vendors that rely on GUIDs should be capable of handling GUIDs that change from the OPK initialization values to those that are generated by the operating system. It is a way for OEMs to simplify operating system pre-installation and system recovery. This command can easily be extended to create a default disk configuration for the platform. For example, the computer manufacturer could extend the MAKE command to automatically partition the boot drive with an Extensible Firmware Interface System Partition, Microsoft Reserved Partition, an OEM-specific partition, and one basic data partition. For example, consider a possible disk configuration called BOOT_DISK. In the event of disaster recovery, MAKE BOOT_DISK would allow the customer to completely repartition a boot disk to the original factory defaults. Windows XP will generate new GUIDs for any duplicate Disk GUID, Microsoft Reserved Partition GUID, or Microsoft Reserved Partition basic data GUID upon detection. This is similar to the duplicate MBR signature handling in Windows 2000. Duplicate GUIDs on a dynamic container or database partition cause unpredictable results. This depends on the cluster size that is selected at the time of formatting. NTFS is currently limited to 2^32-1 allocation units. This yields a 256TB volume, using 64k clusters. However, this has only been tested to 16TB, or 17,592,186,040,320 bytes, using 4K cluster size. The following chart shows the NTFS limits based on cluster size: For example, to format a volume that has a cluster size of 8 KB, you would use a command such as the following from a command prompt, where/a: ####specifies the number of bytes per cluster: If you choose a cluster size that is too small for the size of the partition, you receive the following error message when you try to format the partition: The format operation did not complete because the cluster count is higher than expected To determine the cluster size of a volume, run the following command at a command prompt, and then note theBytes Per Clustervalue: Note The <volume> placeholder represents the volume letter.

","This article addresses frequently asked questions about private offers from independent software vendors (ISVs) to customers in Partner Center. Private offers let you transact private deals with your customers in the commercial marketplace. This new feature supports many new capabilities and addresses limitations associated with private plans. You can use it to:  * Requires a publicly transactable offer in the marketplace. You can create private offers for all transactable offer types: SaaS, Azure VM, Azure container and Azure application. Private offers aren't currently available in Microsoft AppSource. On thePrivate offersdashboard, you can: To offer your employees free access to your products by using the marketplace: After you finish these steps, Microsoft charges only the infrastructure cost for any usage or subscription on that billing account. To create a private offer, you need the billing account ID of your customer. Billing account information is available only to customers. Publishers can't access it. Customers can find the billing account information in the Azure portal by going toCost Management + Billing>Settings>Properties. Or, if a customer knows the subscription that they plan to use for the purchase, they can find their billing account information in the Azure portal by selectingSubscriptions, selecting the relevant subscription, and then going toProperties(orBilling Properties). To access this information, the customer must be an owner or contributor on the billing account. If a customer doesn't have a billing account, they can create one by signing up on Azure.com. SeeBilling account scopes in the Azure portal. With the private offer applied at the level of the billing account ID, if new subscriptions are added to the customer's Azure plan, the private offer automatically applies to those subscriptions. You don't need to make edits to the private offer. While you're creating a new private offer, selectAccepted dateas the start date to make the price available for the customer to transact as soon as the private offer is accepted. ChooseSpecific monthto make the private price available in a future calendar month. For example: If you create a private offer on May 15 and want the private price to be available to the customer on June 1, selectJune. The private offer starts on the first day of the month and ends on the last day. You can't select specific start and end dates. If the customer purchases the public offer or plan before June 1, they won't receive the private offer price for any transactions before June 1. The time zone for the start date is Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Note If a private offer is extended to an existing customer of pay-as-you-go consumption-based products like virtual machines, selectingAccepted datemakes the private price applicable for the entire month. For example: If you create a private offer on May 15 for a virtual machine product and selectAccepted date, the private price will apply for the entire month of acceptance. TheAccept bydate is the private offer's expiration date. Your customer must accept the private offer before the end of this date or the private offer expires.End datespecifies the date on which the private price and terms end. The time zone for the accept-by date and the end date is UTC. You can document and upload custom terms and conditions that you and the customer agreed upon as part of the private deal. The customer is required to legally accept these terms and conditions as part of accepting the private offer. Uploading custom terms and conditions is optional in a private offer. You can upload only one document, and it must be in PDF format. Custom terms and conditions between you and the customer shouldn't violate any terms in the Microsoft Publisher Agreement. It depends. If you want to use the public terms of use for the private offer with no changes, you can skip uploading any custom terms and conditions to the private offer. Public terms of use are presented to the customer during purchase of the private offer. If you want to amend the public terms for the private offer, you need to upload custom terms and conditions to the private offer. Custom terms and conditions are presented to the customer during purchase of the private offer. You can use a discounted price to provide a percentage-based discount on top of a publicly listed plan. You can specify a discounted price only when the private price is lower than the publicly listed plan price. You can use an absolute price to specify a price point that's higher, lower, or equal to the publicly listed plan price. You can apply an absolute price only at a plan level. You can't apply an absolute price for VM offer types or any plans that have a trial enabled. The clone option creates an editable copy of an existing private offer that you can publish as a new private offer. You can use cloning on any private offer, regardless of its status. You can upgrade an existing private offer that a customer accepted. The marketplace supports upgrades only at renewal. For example, the upgraded offer's start and end date can't overlap with the existing private offer. You can edit only pricing, dates, terms, and notification contacts for the upgraded private offer. If you need other changes, create a new private offer. You can't change a private offer in aPending Acceptancestate. If the customer hasn't accepted the private offer, you can withdraw the offer from the customer to make changes. After you withdraw a private offer, your customer can't access it unless you resubmit it to the customer. Private offers created undercustomize pricing for existing public offers and plansmust be unique and not overlap with another customer private offer or multiparty private offer for the same customer billing account ID, using the same base public plan, with overlapping private offer start and end dates. Overlapping private offers are blocked at submission in Partner Center. To remedy this conflict, you have several options depending on whether the customer has already accepted the private offer.  Note For private offers published before 2025 with the same customer billing account ID, same product plan(s), and overlapping private offer start and end dates, the price is determined as follows: Partner Center uses theNotification Contactsinformation to notify you of changes to the private offer status. The notification email is sent when the private offer status changes fromIn ProgresstoPending Acceptance,Pending AcceptancetoAccepted, orPending AcceptancetoExpired. No, Microsoft doesn't send any notifications to the customer. You should copy the private offer link and send it to the customer for acceptance. No. You're notified via the SaaS fulfillment API that a SaaS offer is activated but not that it has an associated private offer. You can see if the customer accepted a private offer in theInsightsreporting. You can't upgrade a private offer during the offer's term. You can create an upgrade at any time and a customer could accept it, but the upgrade takes effect only at the end of the existing private offer. Use theUpgradefeature to extend the start and end date and to include revised custom terms and conditions associated with the private offer. To add or remove offers and plans, create a new private offer. Any user within the customer's organization can see the details of a private offer. To accept a private offer, the user in the customer organization needs to be an owner, contributor, or admin on the billing account. Without appropriate permissions, the user can't accept the private offer. To get access to the billing account, the user should contact the admin or owner. A red notice at the top of the page indicates three people in the customer's organization who have the appropriate permissions. After a private offer is accepted, it's a legal agreement between you and the customer, so it can't be changed. If the private offer is due to begin on the accepted date, the customer can go to the Azure portal to subscribe to the offer by using any Azure subscription associated with the billing account. The customer must use an Azure subscription associated with the configured billing account to get the private price. If the private offer includes pay-as-you-go offers (virtual machines) and was extended to an existing customer, the customer is charged at the private price as soon as the private offer is accepted. For a private offer that includes SaaS, the customer must subscribe to the SaaS product and then configure the product within 30 days of subscribing to it. If you configured the private offer to begin at a future date, your customer could accept the private offer before the accept-by date but should not complete the purchase until after the private offer's start date. After the customer accepts the private offer, it can take up to 15 minutes for the private price to appear in the marketplace on the product details page. If the customer transacts within these 15 minutes, the marketplace still charges the customer correctly by using the private price. Accepting a private offer doesn't initiate billing. To complete the purchase, customers must subscribe to the SaaS product or deploy the virtual machine or Azure application product within the private offer in the Azure portal. For a private offer that includes a SaaS product, the customer must also configure the product within 30 days of subscribing to it. If the customer chose automatic renewal, and you don't create a new private offer that the customer accepts, the customer is charged the list price of the public plan. Yes. Customers who have a Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment can decrement it for benefit-eligible purchases through customer private offers. Customers can't decrement their Azure Consumption Commitment for product purchases through CSP private offers. There are no changes in the payout experience for private offers. After a customer transacts by using private offers, the transaction details appear on theEarningspage in Partner Center. In theInsightsworkspace, you can filter theOrdersandUsagereports by private offers and public offers. You should use private offers for your negotiated deals on Azure Marketplace. Private plans continue to be supported and can be used for specific scenarios. For example, you can use a private plan if you want to use a private (custom) VM image for your customer as part of the private deal or if it meets requirements for their specific use case. To use private offers, ISVs must have publicly transactable plans published to Azure Marketplace. We don't recommend that you have both a private plan and a private offer for the same customer, product, and time period. Private plans can continue to exist for existing deals, and you can use private offers for new deals. Move customers to private offers as each customer's private plan term comes up for renewal or expiration. You can create a private offer that will begin at the end of the current subscription term for the private plan. After your customers accept the private offer, they need to subscribe to the plan that your private offer contains. You can also move your customers to private offers in the middle of a private plan term. If a customer paid for the full term of the original private plan, create a private offer and set the customer price to $0 or apply a 100% discount to your retail price. Your customer then needs to accept the private offer terms and subscribe to the products within the private offer. Private offers support monthly, annual, two-year, or three-year terms. If your customer has a remaining duration that's different from these terms, it's best for the customer to complete the private plan term before subscribing to a private offer. For example, if your customer is in year two of a three-year private plan term and is due to pay for a third year, you can create a private offer for a one-year duration to charge the customer's final year via a private offer. Your customer then needs to cancel the original subscription to the private plan to avoid being charged as part of renewing the private plan. You can then stop-sell the private plan.

Windows Update for Business reports supports clients running asupported version of Windows 10 or Windows 11Professional, Education, Enterprise, and Enterprise multi-session editions. Windows Update for Business reports only provides data for the standard Desktop Windows client version and isn't currently compatible with Windows Server, Surface Hub, IoT, or other versions. Important Currently there is a known issue where Windows Update for Business reports doesn't display data for Enterprise multi-session edition devices. After verifying theprerequisitesare met, you can start to set up Windows Update for Business reports.
The two main steps for setting up  Windows Update for Business reports are: Typically, theWaiting for Windows Update for Business reports datamessage is displayed because: A400 Bad Request: The specified resource already existserror message indicates that the service already has a subscription and workspace mapping saved. If you're trying to re-enroll with the same configuration settings, wait a few minutes, then refresh the page before saving your subscription and workspace again. Sometimes it can take time to register the save, so it's important to not re-enroll too quickly. If you're seeing the device ID but not the device name, it's possible that the required policy for displaying the device name isn't set on the client. Ensure clients have the policy configured. Here are some reasons why you may not be seeing devices in reports: Devices have multiple records when theUCClientUpdateStatusorUCClientServiceStatustables are queried. These tables contain multiple records because they have the history for all devices that have discovered applicable updates within the past 28 days. For example, it's possible that a device has discovered multiple security updates, each with different update states, at various times over the past 28 days. It's also possible that a device can be in multiple deployments, so multiple records are displayed. An unknown client state is displayed if there isn't an update record for the device. This state can happen for many reasons, like the device not being active, not being able to scan Windows Update, or it doesn't currently have any update related activity occurring. The wordtargetin data labels refers to the update version, build, or KB the client intends to update to. Typically, the fields starting withOS, such as OSbuild and OSversion, represents what the device is currently running. These tables can be used for the following information: UCClient: Represents an individual device's record. It contains data such as the device's name, currently installed build, and the OS Edition. Each device has one record in this table. Use this table to get the overall compliance status of your devices. UCClientUpdateStatus: Contains records for every update the device determined was applicable. There can be multiple records for a device if it's discovered multiple applicable updates in the past 60 days. Use this table if you want to get detailed update status for your active deployments. There will typically be 3 update status records per device for the latest 3 security updates. UCUpdateAlert: Use this table to understand update failures and act on devices through alert recommendations. This table contains information that needs attention, relative to one device, one update, and one deployment (if relevant). Windows quality updates are monthly updates that arereleased on the second or fourth Tuesday of the month. The cumulative updates released on the second Tuesday of the month can contain both security updates and nonsecurity updates. Cumulative updates released on the fourth Tuesday of the month are optional nonsecurity preview releases. Use the fields within theUCClient tablefor additional information, such as: Once enrollment is done and devices are properly configured to share data, wait for 48 hours for data to start showing up in reports.

SeeCost and usage data updates and retention. SeeCosts included in Cost Management. Yes. Allocated costs are factored into and supported by budgets and forecasts. Budget and forecast views show costs allocated to them, as configured by cost allocation rules. When a cost allocation rule is deleted, all open and current billing month costs being allocated to the targets are removed. If the cost allocation rule existed for several months, the historical previous months of allocation data remain as originally set by the allocation rule. Cost allocation rules are created at either the enrollment scope (Enterprise Agreement) or the Billing account scope (Microsoft Customer Agreement). Permissions to make changes at these scopes requires billing administrator privileges. Rules that have either overlapping sources or overlapping targets aren't recommended. Cost Allocation rules apply in order by their creation date, so if any cost allocation rules overlap the allocation rule with the earliest creation date takes precedence. Yes. Partners with an MCA agreement can buy New Commerce license and consumption products in the Partner Center.

Ensure that you have their email address and a preferred sign-in method, such as via work/school authentication or Microsoft Live ID, available. If you aren't the EA administrator, reach out to your EA administrators in your company to request that they add you to the enrollment. Once they add you to the enrollment, you receive an activation email. However, if the EA administrators aren't able to assist you, we're able to add you on their behalf if you can provide us with: Once you have all the required information, submit a support request in the Azure portal. An EA enrollment can have multiple EA administrators. You can reach out to another EA administrator to have new EA administrator/account owners/department admin added. However, if you aren't clear on who is the EA administrator in your company or there's no other available EA administrator on the enrollment, reach out to us with the following information: If there are other EA administrators on the enrollment, we reach out to the EA administrators to request for approval on administrative changes on the enrollment. Enrollments are in pending status if the initial EA administrator didn't sign in to the enrollment. If you're an enterprise customer, sign in to Azure portal. On the billing scope page, select your billing account. When you're on the enrollment overview page, the status is updated fromPendingtoActive. Navigate to thePropertiesmenu to view the update status. When new Account Owners (AO) are added to the enrollment for the first time, they always show as ""pending"" under status.

If you signed in as an Azure EA account owner with the same credentials as your Visual Studio subscription, you can recover your individual Visual Studio subscription Azure benefit by performing one of the following actions: Azure Enterprise customers have two types of subscription offers: For more information,contact Azure sales. For more information, seeEnterprise Dev/Test offer. When you create a subscription, the name defaults to the offer type you choose. We recommend that you change the subscription name to something that makes it easy for you to track the subscription. To change the name: To track cost by cost center, you need to define the cost center at one of the following levels: Based on your needs, you can use the same cost center to track usage and costs associated with a particular cost center. For example, to track costs for a special project where multiple departments are involved, you might want to define the cost center at a subscription level to track the usage and costs. You can't define a cost center at the service level. If you want to track usage at the service level, you can use theTagfeature available at the service level. You can create as many departments as you need under your Azure EA enrollment. In order to track the usage correctly, ensure that you're not sharing subscriptions across departments. After you create departments and subscriptions, you can see data in the usage report. This information can help you track usage and manage cost and spend at the department level. You can also access usage data via the reporting API. Direct enterprise customers can view usage and spending at different department levels in the Azure portal. Navigate to theDepartmentmenu to view charges. You can set a spending quota at department level and the system automatically notifies you as your spending limits meet 50%, 75%, 90%, and 100% of the quota you define. To define your spending quota, select a department and then select the edit icon. After you edit the spending limit details, selectSave. If you useresource groupsandtags, this information is tracked at service level, and you can access it in the detailed usage download (CSV) file. You can also access usage via API. Note You can only apply tags to resources that support Azure Resource Manager operations. If you created a virtual machine, virtual network, or storage through the classic deployment model (such as through the classic portal), you can't apply a tag to that resource. You must redeploy these resources through the Resource Manager to support tagging. All other resources support tagging. Yes, you can use theCost Management connector for Power BI Desktopto create powerful, customized visualizations and reports that help you better understand your Azure spend. If you are on an Enterprise Agreement (EA), you can also utilize theCost Management template app. The Cost Management template app comes with premade reports to assist you with monitor costs, service usage trends, and identifying cost optimization options to reduce your expenditures.               Power BI reporting is available for Azure EA direct, partner, and indirect customers who are able to view billing information. Yes. All Azure subscriptions for which you're the account owner are converted to your Enterprise Agreement. Included are subscriptions that use monthly credit such as Visual Studio, AzurePass, Microsoft Cloud Partner Program, and more. You lose monthly credit when converting such subscriptions. Only one account owner is permitted per subscription. More roles can be added using Role-Based Access or (Access Control (IAM)) in the subscription tab in the upper left corner of the page of theAzure portal. Yes, you can transfer subscription ownership to different account. For example, if an Account A has three subscriptions, the enterprise administrator is able to transfer one subscription to Account B, one to Account C, and one to Account D. Or they can transfer all subscriptions to Account E. Enterprise customers can transfer their subscription ownership to another account in the Azure portal. Navigate to theAccountorSubscriptionmenu to transfer ownership. No, an account owner can only be associated to a single department. The policy helps ensure accurate monitoring and apportioning of costs and spending associated to the department that it aligns with under the EA enrollment. No, a subscription owner must be a unique Microsoft account (MSA) or Microsoft Entra authentication. To account for succession within your organization, you should consider creating generic accounts and using Microsoft Entra ID to manage subscription access. An Azure account owner can create and manage an unlimited number of subscriptions. Today, policy does it; meaning you would need to require that for every subscription created, your account is added to a subscription role using role-based access. Before you can create an enterprise Azure (EA) offer subscription, your account must be added to the role of account owner by your EA enrollment's administrator in the Azure portal. Or, you must be an Enterprise Administrator. You need to sign in to the Azure portal to obtain your entitlement to create EA offer type subscriptions. We recommend that your first EA subscription is created from the+ Add Subscriptionlink in Azure portal. However, once your account is entitled it might be easier to create subscriptions in portal.azure.com in the subscription tab in the upper left corner of the page, where you can both create and rename your subscription in a single step. To create an enterprise Azure offer type subscription, you must be entitled in the role of account owner or enterprise administrator in the Azure portal. Enterprise administrators can provide account owners and department administrators with access to cost and pricing information in the Azure portal. Navigate to thePoliciesmenu to change settings. Note If you're an account owner or department administrator, contact your enterprise administrator to enable the pricing feature. Forindirect enrollmentcustomers, contact your partner to check that they enabled the pricing feature for you. Only the partner does it. After you're enabled, you can view the cost and pricing on your enrollment as an enterprise administrator. Partners, if you want to enable the view charges feature for an account owner or a department administrator, follow the steps underdirect enrollment. The usage detail report doesn't contain SKU information. The report does, however, contain usage information so you can download the price sheet report to obtain the SKU information. The Azure Marketplace charges report shows only the usage-based charges. One-time fees aren't shown. See the usage summary page for the most up-to-date usage-based charges and one-time fees. For issues with Power BI, log a ticket with thePower BI support team. Resource tags are managed on the Azure portal. You can contact the Azure subscription team in theAzure portal. Follow the steps in theHow to create an Azure support requestarticle. The resource rate shown in the detailed usage report is a calculated value. It represents the average monthly rate that was charged for the service. The resource rate is calculated from the average of your monthly commitment and your monthly overage charges for a unit of service. The portion of usage charged against your commitment and overage rates change to the day the month closes. Thus, the listed resource rate also changes during the month. The resource rate locks on the fifth day following the end of the month. As of March 1, 2018, some third-party reseller services consume Azure EA Prepayment. Except for Azure reserved VM instances (RIs), services were previously billed outside Azure EA Prepayment and were invoiced separately. We expanded the use of Azure Prepayment to include some of the third-party published Azure Marketplace services that are purchased most frequently. Azure EA Prepayment for these services in Azure Marketplace helps simplify your purchase and payment management. The change was made because customers wanted other ways to use the upfront Azure Prepayment. This change was frequently requested by customers, and it impacted a large portion of Azure Marketplace customers. You get a simpler billing experience and are better able to spend your Azure EA Prepayment. Because the services are included in your Azure Prepayment, your Azure EA Prepayment becomes more valuable. When you purchase a service that uses Azure Prepayment, Azure Marketplace presents a disclaimer. Some supported services are published by Red Hat, SUSE, Autodesk, and Oracle. Currently, similarly named services published by other parties don't deduct from Azure Prepayment. Seethird-party services that use Azure Prepaymentfor a complete list of products participating in the program. If you consume all your Azure Prepayment and go into overage, charges related to these services appear on your next overage invoice along with any other consumption services. Before the March 1, 2018 change, these charges were invoiced with other Azure Marketplace services. We frequently work to deliver the best customer experience related to Azure EA Prepayment. The latest changes to Azure EA prepayment addressed a large number of customers and a significant portion of the total spend in Azure Marketplace. Other services might be added in the future. There's no effect to our indirect enrollment customers or partners. These services are subject to the same partner markup capabilities as other consumption services. The only change is that the charges appear on a different invoice, and the payment of the charges comes out of the customer's Azure EA Prepayment. Specific Azure Marketplace offers can use Azure Prepayment funds. Seethird-party services that use Azure Prepaymentfor a complete list of products participating in the program. Any user from the partner organization who works on a customer's Power Apps resources can link the partner ID to the account. Ideally, the association in PAL should be done at the beginning of the project. However, it can be performed whenever you have access in the customer's directory. Yes. A linked partner ID can be changed, added, or removed. One example for this situation might be when an employee from your company leaves your organization. Another example might be when a project or contract with the customer ends. The link between the partner ID and the account is done for each customer tenant. Link the partner ID in each customer tenant. The link is associated at the user account level. Only you can edit or remove the link to the partner ID. The customer and other partners can't change the link to the partner ID. Be sure to use theAssociated Partner IDshown in your partner profile. It's usually the local account ID association with your organization. PAL enables Microsoft to identify and recognize those partners who are helping customers achieve business goals and realize value in the cloud. Customers must first provide a partner access to their Power Apps resource. Once access is granted, the partner's Partner ID is associated. This association helps Microsoft understand service providers and to refine the tools and programs needed to best support customers. The PAL association to existing credentials provides no new customer data to Microsoft. It provides the information to Microsoft where a partner is actively involved in a customer's Power Apps environments. Microsoft can attribute usage and influence from customer environment to partner organization based on the account's permissions (Power Apps role) and scope (tenant, Resource Group, Resource) provided to the partner by customer. PAL association only adds the partner's Partner ID to the credential already provisioned. It doesn't alter any permissions (Power Apps role) or provide extra Power Apps service data to the partner or Microsoft.

It's also possible that a device can be in multiple deployments, so multiple records are displayed. An unknown client state is displayed if there isn't an update record for the device. This state can happen for many reasons, like the device not being active, not being able to scan Windows Update, or it doesn't currently have any update related activity occurring. The wordtargetin data labels refers to the update version, build, or KB the client intends to update to. Typically, the fields starting withOS, such as OSbuild and OSversion, represents what the device is currently running. These tables can be used for the following information: UCClient: Represents an individual device's record. It contains data such as the device's name, currently installed build, and the OS Edition. Each device has one record in this table. Use this table to get the overall compliance status of your devices. UCClientUpdateStatus: Contains records for every update the device determined was applicable. There can be multiple records for a device if it's discovered multiple applicable updates in the past 60 days. Use this table if you want to get detailed update status for your active deployments. There will typically be 3 update status records per device for the latest 3 security updates. UCUpdateAlert: Use this table to understand update failures and act on devices through alert recommendations. This table contains information that needs attention, relative to one device, one update, and one deployment (if relevant). Windows quality updates are monthly updates that arereleased on the second or fourth Tuesday of the month. The cumulative updates released on the second Tuesday of the month can contain both security updates and nonsecurity updates. Cumulative updates released on the fourth Tuesday of the month are optional nonsecurity preview releases.

Can I sort the records in the customer leaderboard and the geographic spread widget?,"Yes, you sort a column in the widget in ascending or descending order.","This article answers some common questions you might have about searching and filtering in Business Central. Yes. Business Central applies the search criteria to all fields that display on the page. If a field is hidden, such as by using personalization, search ignores the field. Search criteria are applied to fields only if their data type matches that of the search criteria. For example, searching for the termtodaysearches all text and code fields for the literal value ""today,"" and date fields wheretodayis evaluated as an expression for the current date. Search doesn't look in numeric fields. To learn more about filter criteria, go toFilter criteria and operators. Search and filter are optimized for mouse-free interaction with data. There are various shortcut keys that you can use to speed up your work. To learn more, go toKeyboard Shortcuts. The filter pane is available on pages where the list is the primary content on the page, such as worksheets and list pages, including lists reachable from the navigation bar. The filter pane isn't yet available for lists that display as parts. For example, FactBoxes or Role Center parts, or for lists that display as dialogs, such as in lookups. When a list is embedded on a page, such as sales lines on a sales order, the filter pane is available when focusing on that list using the focus mode button. For more information, seeFocusing on Line Items. Your filters and adjustments to predefined filters are remembered throughout the session (while you remain signed in), even if you navigate away from the page. You can permanently save filters as a named view of the list by choosing theicon in the filter pane. For more information, seeList Views FAQ. Unlike filters, search text isn't kept when you leave a page and isn't saved when you save a view. On report request pages, you can also save filters or use predefined filters. For more information, seeUse Saved Settings. Business Central builds upon these popular features and delivers a modern and highly usable experience for finding and analyzing your data. With more keyboard shortcuts and the introduction of search, Business Central surpasses the functionality provided in Dynamics NAV. On different display targets, such as mobile devices or in Outlook, you can search in lists but can't filter on individual fields in most cases. In the Business Central app for Microsoft Teams, both search and filter are available on lists. After you enter search terms in the search box, you can view the exact search criteria and which fields they were applied to. Open the page inspection pane (Ctrl+Alt+F1), and choose thePage Filterstab. There's a time-limit for how long search operations can take. First, try changing the search criteria and search again. If you're using Business Central on-premises, contact your system administrator, because an administrator can increase the time-limit for searches. As an on-premises administrator, you increase the time-limit on searches by changing theSearch Timeoutsetting of Business Central server. For more information, seeConfiguring Business Central Serverin the Business Central Developer and IT Pro Help. We're constantly listening to feedback from our community and acting on the top suggestions.

Can I apply filters to the report?,Yes. You can use the dashboard filters to view the widgets on the dashboard based on the filtered criteria you choose.,"APPLIES TO:Power BI Report BuilderPower BI Desktop This article answers frequently asked questions about paginated reports. These reports are highly formatted, print-ready output optimized for printing or PDF generation. They're called ""paginated"" because they're formatted to fit well on multiple pages. Paginated reports are based on the RDL report technology in SQL Server Reporting Services. This article answers many common questions people have about paginated reports in Power BI, and about Power BI Report Builder, the standalone tool for authoring paginated reports. To learn more about licensing, seeLicensing the Power BI service for users in your organization. Note A ""free"" license is only good if the customer is using an F64 SKU or P1 SKU or higher. Otherwise the customer would be required to have a Pro or PPU license to view Power BI content. Paginated reports are available as part of a Power BI Pro license without needing to purchase a Premium capacity. Size of recommended Premium/Fabric capacity would depend upon expected usage. Use thecapacity planningdocumentation for estimating the size of the capacity needed. User access for paginated reports is the same as user access for all other content in the Power BI service. The audit logs detail usage of this report type under the following events: The field ReportType has the value ""PaginatedReport"" to identify paginated as opposed to Power BI reports. Also, the audit logs provide the following events for paginated reports: You don't need a Power BI Pro license or a PPU license to create paginated reports, or to publish them to My Workspace in the Power BI service. We encourage you todownload and use Power BI Report Builder. You do need a Power BI Pro license or a PPU license to publish paginated reports to other workspaces. Power BI reports are optimized for exploration and interactivity.  A sales report where different salespeople want to slice the data in the same report for their specific region/industry/customer and see how the numbers change would be best served by a Power BI report. Paginated reports are operational reports optimized for printing. Examples of paginated reports include invoices, financial statements and, inventory report. For more information, seeWhen to use paginated reports in Power BI. If your report renders differently than you expected, check if you're using preview features. If the report now renders as expected, leave preview features disabled for now. Otherwise, you can reenable preview features by selecting theEnable preview featuresbutton on theFilemenu. After 30 days, preview features are automatically reenabled, but you can disable them again through the same steps. Yes, but the Power BI service only allows you to upload a single item at a time, so many of the scenarios authors use with SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) aren't yet supported. See the fulllist of unsupported featuresavailable later in this FAQ.You can also create simple, single-table reports on the Power BI service. See the list ofcapabilities. We released Power BI Report Builder as the primary authoring tool for paginated reports in the Power BI Service. InstallPower BI Report Builder from the Microsoft Download Center. If you're using SQL Server 2022 Reporting Services, this article,Publish .rdl files to Power BI from Reporting Services, explains how to migrate. If you're using previous versions of SQL Server Reporting Services, a project on GitHub supports migrating content from SQL Server Reporting Services to Power BI.  View details and download the:RDL Migration Tool. Yes. We've added support for opening reports and publishing them directly to the service from Power BI Report Builder.

You also see them in other parts of the new Home experience. Query time-out values are specified during report authoring when you define an embedded dataset. The time-out value is stored with the report, in the Timeout element of the report definition. By default, this value is set to 600 seconds. For longer running queries, set a max timeout value of 2147483646 in the Dataset Properties dialog in Power BI Report Builder. When working with DateTime fields in paginated reports, keep in mind that currently there are some globalization limitations related to DateTime parameters. All DateTime parameters in the Power BI service are fetched in US format (MM/DD/YYYY) regardless of how you design the DataTime in Power BI Report Builder. In some customer scenarios, admins have allowed external users to their organization access to workspaces and content. What is an external user? One example would be a BikeManufacturer (user@MyBikes.com) account that has been given access to the Contoso (user@Contoso.com) tenant. An external user may see an ""Access denied"" error or see no content with Power BI Report Builder when accessing workspaces, or editing or creating reports. We look to adding this functionality in a future update. Paginated reports are limited to 250 data sources per report. Generally, customers have three or four data sources per report. We have set an upper limit of 250 data sources. If the report has more data sources than 250, the report doesn't publish. If it's an existing published report, the report isn't rendered.

However, since October 1, 2021, any commercial incentive offers that are new or undergo rule changes are launched as engagements under Microsoft Commerce Incentives or as new levers under existing engagements (think of engagements as containers). Note This does not apply to OEM (original equipment manufacturers) yet. Any transactions on new commerce will only be incentivized through a Microsoft Commerce Incentive engagement. Engagement names are unique and could change over time as they align around program refresh periods. Lever names could be the same across engagements and could change.

If you're seeing the device ID but not the device name, it's possible that the required policy for displaying the device name isn't set on the client. Ensure clients have the policy configured. Here are some reasons why you may not be seeing devices in reports: Devices have multiple records when theUCClientUpdateStatusorUCClientServiceStatustables are queried. These tables contain multiple records because they have the history for all devices that have discovered applicable updates within the past 28 days. For example, it's possible that a device has discovered multiple security updates, each with different update states, at various times over the past 28 days. It's also possible that a device can be in multiple deployments, so multiple records are displayed. An unknown client state is displayed if there isn't an update record for the device. This state can happen for many reasons, like the device not being active, not being able to scan Windows Update, or it doesn't currently have any update related activity occurring. The wordtargetin data labels refers to the update version, build, or KB the client intends to update to. Typically, the fields starting withOS, such as OSbuild and OSversion, represents what the device is currently running.

Each device has one record in this table. Use this table to get the overall compliance status of your devices. UCClientUpdateStatus: Contains records for every update the device determined was applicable. There can be multiple records for a device if it's discovered multiple applicable updates in the past 60 days. Use this table if you want to get detailed update status for your active deployments. There will typically be 3 update status records per device for the latest 3 security updates. UCUpdateAlert: Use this table to understand update failures and act on devices through alert recommendations. This table contains information that needs attention, relative to one device, one update, and one deployment (if relevant). Windows quality updates are monthly updates that arereleased on the second or fourth Tuesday of the month.

Each device has one record in this table. Use this table to get the overall compliance status of your devices. UCClientUpdateStatus: Contains records for every update the device determined was applicable. There can be multiple records for a device if it's discovered multiple applicable updates in the past 60 days. Use this table if you want to get detailed update status for your active deployments. There will typically be 3 update status records per device for the latest 3 security updates. UCUpdateAlert: Use this table to understand update failures and act on devices through alert recommendations. This table contains information that needs attention, relative to one device, one update, and one deployment (if relevant). Windows quality updates are monthly updates that arereleased on the second or fourth Tuesday of the month. The cumulative updates released on the second Tuesday of the month can contain both security updates and nonsecurity updates. Cumulative updates released on the fourth Tuesday of the month are optional nonsecurity preview releases.

General questions: Setup questions: Questions about using Windows Update for Business reports: Delivery Optimization data: Windows Update for Business reports is a cloud-based solution that provides information about your Microsoft Entra joined devices' compliance with Windows updates. Windows Update for Business reports is offered through theAzure portal, and it's included as part of the Windows 10 or Windows 11 prerequisite licenses. Data ingested into your Log Analytics workspace can be retained at no charge for up to first 31 days (or 90 days ifMicrosoft Sentinelis enabled on the workspace). Data ingested intoApplication Insights, either classic or workspace-based, is retained for 90 days without any charge.
Data retained beyond these no-charge periods are charged for each GB of data retained for a month, pro-rated daily. For more information, seeLog Data RetentioninAzure Monitor pricing. Windows Update for Business reports supports clients running asupported version of Windows 10 or Windows 11Professional, Education, Enterprise, and Enterprise multi-session editions. Windows Update for Business reports only provides data for the standard Desktop Windows client version and isn't currently compatible with Windows Server, Surface Hub, IoT, or other versions. Important Currently there is a known issue where Windows Update for Business reports doesn't display data for Enterprise multi-session edition devices. After verifying theprerequisitesare met, you can start to set up Windows Update for Business reports.
The two main steps for setting up  Windows Update for Business reports are: Typically, theWaiting for Windows Update for Business reports datamessage is displayed because: A400 Bad Request: The specified resource already existserror message indicates that the service already has a subscription and workspace mapping saved. If you're trying to re-enroll with the same configuration settings, wait a few minutes, then refresh the page before saving your subscription and workspace again. Sometimes it can take time to register the save, so it's important to not re-enroll too quickly. If you're seeing the device ID but not the device name, it's possible that the required policy for displaying the device name isn't set on the client. Ensure clients have the policy configured. Here are some reasons why you may not be seeing devices in reports: Devices have multiple records when theUCClientUpdateStatusorUCClientServiceStatustables are queried. These tables contain multiple records because they have the history for all devices that have discovered applicable updates within the past 28 days. For example, it's possible that a device has discovered multiple security updates, each with different update states, at various times over the past 28 days. It's also possible that a device can be in multiple deployments, so multiple records are displayed. An unknown client state is displayed if there isn't an update record for the device. This state can happen for many reasons, like the device not being active, not being able to scan Windows Update, or it doesn't currently have any update related activity occurring. The wordtargetin data labels refers to the update version, build, or KB the client intends to update to. Typically, the fields starting withOS, such as OSbuild and OSversion, represents what the device is currently running.

These reports are highly formatted, print-ready output optimized for printing or PDF generation. They're called ""paginated"" because they're formatted to fit well on multiple pages. Paginated reports are based on the RDL report technology in SQL Server Reporting Services. This article answers many common questions people have about paginated reports in Power BI, and about Power BI Report Builder, the standalone tool for authoring paginated reports. To learn more about licensing, seeLicensing the Power BI service for users in your organization. Note A ""free"" license is only good if the customer is using an F64 SKU or P1 SKU or higher. Otherwise the customer would be required to have a Pro or PPU license to view Power BI content. Paginated reports are available as part of a Power BI Pro license without needing to purchase a Premium capacity. Size of recommended Premium/Fabric capacity would depend upon expected usage. Use thecapacity planningdocumentation for estimating the size of the capacity needed. User access for paginated reports is the same as user access for all other content in the Power BI service. The audit logs detail usage of this report type under the following events: The field ReportType has the value ""PaginatedReport"" to identify paginated as opposed to Power BI reports. Also, the audit logs provide the following events for paginated reports: You don't need a Power BI Pro license or a PPU license to create paginated reports, or to publish them to My Workspace in the Power BI service. We encourage you todownload and use Power BI Report Builder. You do need a Power BI Pro license or a PPU license to publish paginated reports to other workspaces. Power BI reports are optimized for exploration and interactivity.  A sales report where different salespeople want to slice the data in the same report for their specific region/industry/customer and see how the numbers change would be best served by a Power BI report. Paginated reports are operational reports optimized for printing. Examples of paginated reports include invoices, financial statements and, inventory report. For more information, seeWhen to use paginated reports in Power BI. If your report renders differently than you expected, check if you're using preview features. If the report now renders as expected, leave preview features disabled for now. Otherwise, you can reenable preview features by selecting theEnable preview featuresbutton on theFilemenu. After 30 days, preview features are automatically reenabled, but you can disable them again through the same steps. Yes, but the Power BI service only allows you to upload a single item at a time, so many of the scenarios authors use with SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) aren't yet supported. See the fulllist of unsupported featuresavailable later in this FAQ.You can also create simple, single-table reports on the Power BI service. See the list ofcapabilities. We released Power BI Report Builder as the primary authoring tool for paginated reports in the Power BI Service. InstallPower BI Report Builder from the Microsoft Download Center. If you're using SQL Server 2022 Reporting Services, this article,Publish .rdl files to Power BI from Reporting Services, explains how to migrate. If you're using previous versions of SQL Server Reporting Services, a project on GitHub supports migrating content from SQL Server Reporting Services to Power BI.  View details and download the:RDL Migration Tool. Yes. We've added support for opening reports and publishing them directly to the service from Power BI Report Builder. Currently, paginated reports don't support the following items: You get an error message if you try to upload a file that has an unsupported feature in the Power BI service. See the articleSupported data sources for Power BI paginated reportsfor a list of data sources. Yes, we support Power BI semantic models as data sources for your paginated reports. Yes, stored procedures through the Gateway are supported for SQL Server data sources, including those that use parameters. You can export to Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word, Microsoft PowerPoint, accessible PDF, PDF, .CSV, XML, and MHTML. Yes, printing is available for paginated reports, including a new and improved print preview experience. Yes, e-mail subscriptions are fully supported for paginated reports. The details are available in the ""Subscribe to paginated reports"" section of the articleEmail subscriptions for reports and dashboards in the Power BI service. Yes, we support the ability to run code in your reports using code blocks orAzure Functions. Referencing custom code DLL files within a report is not supported. Yes, to learn how to embed a paginated report, refer toEmbed Power BI paginated reports. Yes, this can be accomplished using URL parameters with your paginated reports. Yes, you can deploy paginated reports in apps. Vote for these features onideas. No, a report viewer control isn't available currently. Yes, you can now search for your paginated reports from Home.  You also see them in other parts of the new Home experience. Query time-out values are specified during report authoring when you define an embedded dataset. The time-out value is stored with the report, in the Timeout element of the report definition. By default, this value is set to 600 seconds. For longer running queries, set a max timeout value of 2147483646 in the Dataset Properties dialog in Power BI Report Builder. When working with DateTime fields in paginated reports, keep in mind that currently there are some globalization limitations related to DateTime parameters. All DateTime parameters in the Power BI service are fetched in US format (MM/DD/YYYY) regardless of how you design the DataTime in Power BI Report Builder. In some customer scenarios, admins have allowed external users to their organization access to workspaces and content. What is an external user? One example would be a BikeManufacturer (user@MyBikes.com) account that has been given access to the Contoso (user@Contoso.com) tenant. An external user may see an ""Access denied"" error or see no content with Power BI Report Builder when accessing workspaces, or editing or creating reports. We look to adding this functionality in a future update. Paginated reports are limited to 250 data sources per report. Generally, customers have three or four data sources per report. We have set an upper limit of 250 data sources. If the report has more data sources than 250, the report doesn't publish. If it's an existing published report, the report isn't rendered.

What is the difference between Total offers and Offer count?,"Total offers refers to how many there are in the entire category. For example, if you set the ""category"" filter to security, it's showing how many offers there are in the marketplace under the category Security. Offer count shows the count of offers in the category whose retention scores are above zero. So if you have the Category filter set to Security, the Y axis of the graph is showing how many offers in security have retention scores above 0.","This article addresses frequently asked questions about private offers from independent software vendors (ISVs) to customers in Partner Center. Private offers let you transact private deals with your customers in the commercial marketplace. This new feature supports many new capabilities and addresses limitations associated with private plans. You can use it to:  * Requires a publicly transactable offer in the marketplace. You can create private offers for all transactable offer types: SaaS, Azure VM, Azure container and Azure application. Private offers aren't currently available in Microsoft AppSource. On thePrivate offersdashboard, you can: To offer your employees free access to your products by using the marketplace: After you finish these steps, Microsoft charges only the infrastructure cost for any usage or subscription on that billing account. To create a private offer, you need the billing account ID of your customer. Billing account information is available only to customers. Publishers can't access it. Customers can find the billing account information in the Azure portal by going toCost Management + Billing>Settings>Properties. Or, if a customer knows the subscription that they plan to use for the purchase, they can find their billing account information in the Azure portal by selectingSubscriptions, selecting the relevant subscription, and then going toProperties(orBilling Properties). To access this information, the customer must be an owner or contributor on the billing account. If a customer doesn't have a billing account, they can create one by signing up on Azure.com. SeeBilling account scopes in the Azure portal. With the private offer applied at the level of the billing account ID, if new subscriptions are added to the customer's Azure plan, the private offer automatically applies to those subscriptions. You don't need to make edits to the private offer. While you're creating a new private offer, selectAccepted dateas the start date to make the price available for the customer to transact as soon as the private offer is accepted. ChooseSpecific monthto make the private price available in a future calendar month. For example: If you create a private offer on May 15 and want the private price to be available to the customer on June 1, selectJune. The private offer starts on the first day of the month and ends on the last day. You can't select specific start and end dates. If the customer purchases the public offer or plan before June 1, they won't receive the private offer price for any transactions before June 1. The time zone for the start date is Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Note If a private offer is extended to an existing customer of pay-as-you-go consumption-based products like virtual machines, selectingAccepted datemakes the private price applicable for the entire month. For example: If you create a private offer on May 15 for a virtual machine product and selectAccepted date, the private price will apply for the entire month of acceptance. TheAccept bydate is the private offer's expiration date. Your customer must accept the private offer before the end of this date or the private offer expires.End datespecifies the date on which the private price and terms end. The time zone for the accept-by date and the end date is UTC. You can document and upload custom terms and conditions that you and the customer agreed upon as part of the private deal. The customer is required to legally accept these terms and conditions as part of accepting the private offer. Uploading custom terms and conditions is optional in a private offer. You can upload only one document, and it must be in PDF format. Custom terms and conditions between you and the customer shouldn't violate any terms in the Microsoft Publisher Agreement. It depends. If you want to use the public terms of use for the private offer with no changes, you can skip uploading any custom terms and conditions to the private offer. Public terms of use are presented to the customer during purchase of the private offer. If you want to amend the public terms for the private offer, you need to upload custom terms and conditions to the private offer. Custom terms and conditions are presented to the customer during purchase of the private offer. You can use a discounted price to provide a percentage-based discount on top of a publicly listed plan. You can specify a discounted price only when the private price is lower than the publicly listed plan price. You can use an absolute price to specify a price point that's higher, lower, or equal to the publicly listed plan price. You can apply an absolute price only at a plan level. You can't apply an absolute price for VM offer types or any plans that have a trial enabled. The clone option creates an editable copy of an existing private offer that you can publish as a new private offer. You can use cloning on any private offer, regardless of its status. You can upgrade an existing private offer that a customer accepted. The marketplace supports upgrades only at renewal. For example, the upgraded offer's start and end date can't overlap with the existing private offer. You can edit only pricing, dates, terms, and notification contacts for the upgraded private offer. If you need other changes, create a new private offer. You can't change a private offer in aPending Acceptancestate. If the customer hasn't accepted the private offer, you can withdraw the offer from the customer to make changes. After you withdraw a private offer, your customer can't access it unless you resubmit it to the customer. Private offers created undercustomize pricing for existing public offers and plansmust be unique and not overlap with another customer private offer or multiparty private offer for the same customer billing account ID, using the same base public plan, with overlapping private offer start and end dates. Overlapping private offers are blocked at submission in Partner Center. To remedy this conflict, you have several options depending on whether the customer has already accepted the private offer.  Note For private offers published before 2025 with the same customer billing account ID, same product plan(s), and overlapping private offer start and end dates, the price is determined as follows: Partner Center uses theNotification Contactsinformation to notify you of changes to the private offer status. The notification email is sent when the private offer status changes fromIn ProgresstoPending Acceptance,Pending AcceptancetoAccepted, orPending AcceptancetoExpired. No, Microsoft doesn't send any notifications to the customer. You should copy the private offer link and send it to the customer for acceptance. No. You're notified via the SaaS fulfillment API that a SaaS offer is activated but not that it has an associated private offer. You can see if the customer accepted a private offer in theInsightsreporting. You can't upgrade a private offer during the offer's term. You can create an upgrade at any time and a customer could accept it, but the upgrade takes effect only at the end of the existing private offer. Use theUpgradefeature to extend the start and end date and to include revised custom terms and conditions associated with the private offer. To add or remove offers and plans, create a new private offer. Any user within the customer's organization can see the details of a private offer. To accept a private offer, the user in the customer organization needs to be an owner, contributor, or admin on the billing account. Without appropriate permissions, the user can't accept the private offer. To get access to the billing account, the user should contact the admin or owner. A red notice at the top of the page indicates three people in the customer's organization who have the appropriate permissions. After a private offer is accepted, it's a legal agreement between you and the customer, so it can't be changed. If the private offer is due to begin on the accepted date, the customer can go to the Azure portal to subscribe to the offer by using any Azure subscription associated with the billing account. The customer must use an Azure subscription associated with the configured billing account to get the private price. If the private offer includes pay-as-you-go offers (virtual machines) and was extended to an existing customer, the customer is charged at the private price as soon as the private offer is accepted. For a private offer that includes SaaS, the customer must subscribe to the SaaS product and then configure the product within 30 days of subscribing to it. If you configured the private offer to begin at a future date, your customer could accept the private offer before the accept-by date but should not complete the purchase until after the private offer's start date. After the customer accepts the private offer, it can take up to 15 minutes for the private price to appear in the marketplace on the product details page. If the customer transacts within these 15 minutes, the marketplace still charges the customer correctly by using the private price. Accepting a private offer doesn't initiate billing. To complete the purchase, customers must subscribe to the SaaS product or deploy the virtual machine or Azure application product within the private offer in the Azure portal. For a private offer that includes a SaaS product, the customer must also configure the product within 30 days of subscribing to it. If the customer chose automatic renewal, and you don't create a new private offer that the customer accepts, the customer is charged the list price of the public plan. Yes. Customers who have a Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment can decrement it for benefit-eligible purchases through customer private offers. Customers can't decrement their Azure Consumption Commitment for product purchases through CSP private offers. There are no changes in the payout experience for private offers. After a customer transacts by using private offers, the transaction details appear on theEarningspage in Partner Center. In theInsightsworkspace, you can filter theOrdersandUsagereports by private offers and public offers. You should use private offers for your negotiated deals on Azure Marketplace. Private plans continue to be supported and can be used for specific scenarios. For example, you can use a private plan if you want to use a private (custom) VM image for your customer as part of the private deal or if it meets requirements for their specific use case. To use private offers, ISVs must have publicly transactable plans published to Azure Marketplace. We don't recommend that you have both a private plan and a private offer for the same customer, product, and time period. Private plans can continue to exist for existing deals, and you can use private offers for new deals. Move customers to private offers as each customer's private plan term comes up for renewal or expiration. You can create a private offer that will begin at the end of the current subscription term for the private plan. After your customers accept the private offer, they need to subscribe to the plan that your private offer contains. You can also move your customers to private offers in the middle of a private plan term. If a customer paid for the full term of the original private plan, create a private offer and set the customer price to $0 or apply a 100% discount to your retail price. Your customer then needs to accept the private offer terms and subscribe to the products within the private offer. Private offers support monthly, annual, two-year, or three-year terms. If your customer has a remaining duration that's different from these terms, it's best for the customer to complete the private plan term before subscribing to a private offer. For example, if your customer is in year two of a three-year private plan term and is due to pay for a third year, you can create a private offer for a one-year duration to charge the customer's final year via a private offer. Your customer then needs to cancel the original subscription to the private plan to avoid being charged as part of renewing the private plan. You can then stop-sell the private plan.

How do I know which customers are retaining and which are churning?,Customersshows this information.,"Last updated August 27, 2024. This article contains answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs) about Microsoft 365 Lighthouse. If you can't find an answer to your question, let us know by providing feedback and we'll add it to this article. Microsoft 365 Lighthouse helps Managed Service Providers (MSPs) grow their business and deliver services to customers at scale through proactive account management, simplified onboarding, efficient tenant configuration, device protection, and alerts. Lighthouse provides insights into customer acquisition, retention, and growth opportunities, as well as multi-tenant views across customer devices, data, and users to help you anticipate customer needs and maximize their investment in Microsoft 365. For MSP service technicians with delegated access, Lighthouse helps you secure and manage devices, data, and users at scale for small and medium business (SMB) customers. Lighthouse simplifies onboarding of tenants by recommending security configuration baselines tailored to SMBs and providing multi-tenant views across all customer environments. For account managers, sales professionals, and customer success users, the Sales Advisor capability within Lighthouse uses artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze your customer base and apply data modelsâ€”built by Microsoft data scientistsâ€”to identify opportunities where you can engage, nurture, and grow your customer's Microsoft 365 usage through actionable recommendations and prescriptive guidance. For more information, seeOverview of Microsoft 365 Lighthouse. No additional costs are associated with using Lighthouse to manage multiple Microsoft 365 customer tenants. Lighthouse is available to MSPs servicing small- to medium-sized businesses and who have a Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) relationship with their customers. For more information, seeRequirements for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse. For a list of current requirements, seeRequirements for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse. Lighthouse is available in all countries where Microsoft 365 is available, except China and Palestinian Authority. However, features in Lighthouse such as device management and threat management rely on Microsoft Intune, and user management relies on Microsoft Entra ID, and Intune and Microsoft Entra ID may not be available in certain countries and regions. For a complete list of Microsoft 365, Microsoft Entra ID, and Intune availability, seeInternational availability. Lighthouse is not available in national clouds. To sign up for Lighthouse, you'll need to be enrolled in the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program as an Indirect Reseller or Direct Bill partner. For instructions on how to sign up, seeSign up for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse. To learn more about the CSP program, see theCloud Solution Provider program overview - Partner Center. Yes, however Lighthouse capabilities will vary based on the licenses assigned to the user. For example, if a user is missing a license that includes Intune, that user's devices, device compliance status, and threats status will be unavailable; and if a user is missing a license that includes Microsoft Entra ID P1, that user's password and sign-in management will be unavailable. For more information, seeRequirements for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse. It can take up to 48 hours for customer tenant data to load within Lighthouse. If it's been more than 48 hours since you completed onboarding, reach out to our Support team for help. You'll need to let them know when you completed onboarding and provide any relevant screenshots and logs. For more information, seeGet help and support for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse. For customer tenant data to show up in Lighthouse, MSPs must establish delegated access to manage the customer tenant. Either granular delegated administrative privileges (GDAP) plus an indirect reseller relationship or a delegated administrative privileges (DAP) relationship is required to onboard customers to Lighthouse. We recommend establishing GDAP with your customers to allow more secure delegated access. If DAP and GDAP coexist in a customer tenant, GDAP permissions take precedence for MSP technicians in GDAP-enabled security groups. For more information on delegated access, seeRequest a reseller relationship with a customer in Partner Center. Tenants also must have at least one Enterprise, Business, Frontline, or Education subscription of Microsoft 365, Office 365, Exchange Online, Windows 365 Business, or Microsoft Defender for Business and no more than 2500 licensed users in their tenant. For more information, seeRequirements for Microsoft 365 LighthouseandOverview of the Tenants page in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse. If GDAP is established with the customer, an MSP technician must be in a GDAP-enabled security group that is assigned the appropriate roles to be able to manage that customer's data in Lighthouse. GDAP roles assigned to that security group impact which customer data can be managed within Lighthouse. SeeOverview of permissions in Microsoft 365 Lighthousefor details on which delegated and partner tenant roles are recommended to use Lighthouse. For instructions on how to view which GDAP roles have been assigned to you for different customer tenants in Lighthouse, seeView your Microsoft Entra roles in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse. If you don't want to see certain tenants and their data in Lighthouse, you can remove those tenants. To remove a tenant, follow these steps: Note Once you remove a tenant, you can't take action on the tenant until the removal process is complete. It may take up to 48 hours for this process to complete. To learn more about tenants, seeMicrosoft 365 Lighthouse tenants page overview. If you can't access tenant information, you may not have the correct permissions for that tenant. Some features and data are only visible to specific roles. To view what roles you have, seeView your Microsoft Entra roles across tenants. No, you can only use Lighthouse to manage customer tenants that you have a reseller or GDAP relationship with. Lighthouse adds comments whenever the system makes a change or updates an alert. Likewise, if a user takes an action on an alert, this is also noted in a comment. These comments provide a running history of all actions taken on the alert. Lighthouse alerts are based on the underlying entity (for example, device or user) and do not correlate to alerts in the associated service portal. If you resolve an alert in the associated service portal but don't make a change to the underlying entity, then the Lighthouse alert remains unchanged. If you make a change to the underlying entity, then the Lighthouse alert status changes toResolved. If an alert is resolved but the underlying issue reappears, the alert triggers again and the status changes toNew. For example, if a risky user alert is resolved, but then the same risky user triggers a new alert with new risky behavior, the alert status changes fromResolvedtoNew. When an alert is dismissed in Lighthouse, the triggering entity (for example, user or device) won't retrigger the same alert for 30 days. After 30 days, any new activity on that entity changes the alert status fromDismissedtoNew. Lighthouse monitors all corresponding service portals across MSPs and their customers. The exact time an alert appears and a notification email is sent varies and is based on the alert rule engine, but MSPs should typically see a new alert appear on theAlertspage in Lighthouse and receive an email notification within minutes of the triggering event. The time stamp in theFirst detectedcolumn indicates the first time the issue was detected by Lighthouse. This time stamp may be slightly different than the time stamp for the alert in the associated service portal. The time stamp in theLast updatedcolumn indicates the time that the issue was last detected by Lighthouse. In the customer tenant's deployment plan, under theSet up Microsoft Defender for Businessdeployment task, dismiss theProvisioningsub-task and selectResolved through a third partyas the reason for dismissal. Do one of the following: Exclude the emergency access admin account from theRequire MFA for adminsdeployment task. In the deployment plan for the customer tenant associated with the emergency access admin account, under theRequire MFA for adminsdeployment task, dismiss theCreate conditional access policy to require MFA for adminssub-task and selectRisk acceptedas the reason for dismissal. Note Dismissal of a deployment task impacts all users in the tenant. Do one of the following: Change the deployment state of the existing configuration toEnabled. Delete the existing configuration, and then deploy a new configuration. Do one of the following: Edit the setting within the existing configuration to make it compliant. Edit the assignment of the existing configuration to exclude the users who have the task assigned to them. Delete the existing configuration. Dismiss the task associated with the configuration that has a non-compliant setting. Note Dismissal of a deployment task impacts all users in the tenant. Do one of the following: Exclude the applicable user accounts from the deployment task. Enable deployment by assigning licenses for the required services to the applicable users. Dismiss the task for the customer tenant. Note Dismissal of a deployment task impacts all users in the tenant. Do one of the following: Exclude the applicable user account from the deployment task. Exclude the applicable security group from the deployment task. Tasks areNot compliantif there are one or more users for which one or more settings in the assigned configuration are eitherMissingorNot compliant. To investigate and resolve a deployment task that'sNot compliant: Open the customer tenant's deployment plan, and then select the task you want to investigate to open the task details pane. SelectUser progressto see which users have a status ofNot compliantorNot licensed. To resolve users who areNot licensed, either assign them the required license or exclude them from the assignment of the task. If there are any users who areNot compliant, selectDetection history, and then select the most recent scan of the tenant to view the tenant configuration. The tenant configuration will identify which settings within which policy for which users are eitherMissingorNot compliant. Do one of the following: Deployment plans areNot completeif there are one or more tasks that areNot licensedorNot compliant. To investigate and resolve a deployment plan that'sNot complete: Open the customer tenant's deployment plan to view the status of the assigned deployment tasks. Review each deployment task that has a status ofNot licensedorNot compliant, and then do one of the following: When a customer tenant's configuration is updated in Lighthouse, the tenant's deployment status is refreshed automatically. However, changes made outside of Lighthouse are not immediately detected. Outside changes won't be detected until the next scheduled Lighthouse scan, or until a detection scan is manually initiated by a Lighthouse user. For instance, if Lighthouse indicates a user isn't licensed for a task, you can resolve this by assigning the required license to the user in the Microsoft 365 admin center. Afterwards, do one of the following to see the license assignment reflected in the deployment status in Lighthouse: If you meet the requirements to use Lighthouse, then you're qualified to manage customer Cloud PCs in Lighthouse. For a list of current requirements, seeRequirements for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse. You can purchase Windows 365 licenses through all available Microsoft commercial sales channels. One license purchased is equivalent to the purchase of one Cloud PC. Currently, each user can be assigned only one Cloud PC of the same SKU type, but they can be assigned multiple Cloud PCs if they are of different SKU types. To compare Windows 365 plans and pricing, seeGet the Windows 365 Cloud PC that's right for you. Understanding how customers interact with a product or solution through data can help partners anticipate customer needs and improve overall performance throughout the various stages of the customer lifecycle.  Microsoft is investing in its partners by creating a tool that supports a customer lifecycle management (CLM) experience and continuous customer engagement across the customer lifecycle. This experience was available during a public preview phase and was referred to as â€œProject Orland for Microsoft 365.â€ The public preview phase has concluded, and this same experience is now generally available as a capability within Microsoft 365 Lighthouse. Leveraging the same data models and insights Microsoft sellers use for account management, partners can: Sales Advisor surfaces opportunities across all segments. The opportunities and the models are not exclusive to SMB customers. CSP partners who support medium-sized customers will find that Sales Advisor serves them well with all the customers they engage with. The Microsoft 365 Lighthouse Sales Advisor capability only supports Modern Work Microsoft 365 services and solutions. Instructions on how to onboard to Lighthouse and how to use the Sales Advisor capabilities are posted onGet access to Sales Advisor. The two offerings serve different purposes and use different signals to generate information shared with partners. Cloud Ascent is a targeting tool focusing on potential cloud customers that partners can move to the cloud. Partners should use Cloud Ascent to support lead generation and new customer marketing. For customers with a Microsoft 365 trial or paid subscription, the sales advisor capability in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse will help partners nurture that customer by converting trials to paid, increasing product adoption, or moving paid customers to more advanced workloads. It is a lifecycle management tool that supports continuous customer engagement. Sales advisor leverages the same data models, insights, and signals that Microsoft sellers use for account management, tapping into the best practices we see across the market to help partners grow their business. Microsoft 365 Lighthouse is focused on Microsoft 365 services rather than Azure services. While Azure Lighthouse is built into the Azure portal and allows IT partners to manage multiple tenants for Azure, Microsoft 365 Lighthouse is a standalone portal that helps MSPs manage multiple Microsoft 365 customer tenants. For more information about Microsoft 365 Lighthouse, seeOverview of Microsoft 365 Lighthouse. For more information about Azure Lighthouse, seeWhat is Azure Lighthouse? Microsoft 365 Lighthouse sources and aggregates information from across your customer tenants through Microsoft Graph APIs. If Microsoft Sentinel is monitoring customer tenants that are managed by Lighthouse, it will detect such API activity and, depending on how Microsoft Sentinel is configured, report it as an incident. You can create an automation rule in Microsoft Sentinel to identify these incidents as false positives and close them automatically. For instructions on how to do this, seeHandle false positives in Microsoft Sentinel. To learn more about Microsoft Sentinel, review theMicrosoft Sentinel technical documentation. The multitenant capabilities in Microsoft Defender XDR provide large organizations with the ability to secure and manage multiple tenants from a single portal, with a focus on global security operations center (SOC) investigation flows, including a unified view of incidents across tenants and the ability to perform advanced search across the data contained in multiple tenants. The capabilities also help enterprise managed security service providers (MSSPs) efficiently run their SOC. For MSPs who manage services for SMB customers and who need a full set of capabilities spanning security, identity, and management of Microsoft 365 applications in a unified experience in a single portal, we continue to recommend Microsoft 365 Lighthouse.  Lighthouse includes a broader set of capabilities optimized for MSPs, particularly those using Microsoft 365 Business Premium and Defender for Business. The following table provides a comparison between Microsoft 365 Lighthouse and the multitenant organization capabilities in Microsoft Defender XDR.

General questions: Setup questions: Questions about using Windows Update for Business reports: Delivery Optimization data: Windows Update for Business reports is a cloud-based solution that provides information about your Microsoft Entra joined devices' compliance with Windows updates. Windows Update for Business reports is offered through theAzure portal, and it's included as part of the Windows 10 or Windows 11 prerequisite licenses. Data ingested into your Log Analytics workspace can be retained at no charge for up to first 31 days (or 90 days ifMicrosoft Sentinelis enabled on the workspace). Data ingested intoApplication Insights, either classic or workspace-based, is retained for 90 days without any charge.
Data retained beyond these no-charge periods are charged for each GB of data retained for a month, pro-rated daily. For more information, seeLog Data RetentioninAzure Monitor pricing. Windows Update for Business reports supports clients running asupported version of Windows 10 or Windows 11Professional, Education, Enterprise, and Enterprise multi-session editions. Windows Update for Business reports only provides data for the standard Desktop Windows client version and isn't currently compatible with Windows Server, Surface Hub, IoT, or other versions. Important Currently there is a known issue where Windows Update for Business reports doesn't display data for Enterprise multi-session edition devices. After verifying theprerequisitesare met, you can start to set up Windows Update for Business reports.
The two main steps for setting up  Windows Update for Business reports are: Typically, theWaiting for Windows Update for Business reports datamessage is displayed because: A400 Bad Request: The specified resource already existserror message indicates that the service already has a subscription and workspace mapping saved. If you're trying to re-enroll with the same configuration settings, wait a few minutes, then refresh the page before saving your subscription and workspace again. Sometimes it can take time to register the save, so it's important to not re-enroll too quickly. If you're seeing the device ID but not the device name, it's possible that the required policy for displaying the device name isn't set on the client. Ensure clients have the policy configured. Here are some reasons why you may not be seeing devices in reports: Devices have multiple records when theUCClientUpdateStatusorUCClientServiceStatustables are queried. These tables contain multiple records because they have the history for all devices that have discovered applicable updates within the past 28 days. For example, it's possible that a device has discovered multiple security updates, each with different update states, at various times over the past 28 days. It's also possible that a device can be in multiple deployments, so multiple records are displayed. An unknown client state is displayed if there isn't an update record for the device. This state can happen for many reasons, like the device not being active, not being able to scan Windows Update, or it doesn't currently have any update related activity occurring. The wordtargetin data labels refers to the update version, build, or KB the client intends to update to. Typically, the fields starting withOS, such as OSbuild and OSversion, represents what the device is currently running. These tables can be used for the following information: UCClient: Represents an individual device's record. It contains data such as the device's name, currently installed build, and the OS Edition. Each device has one record in this table. Use this table to get the overall compliance status of your devices. UCClientUpdateStatus: Contains records for every update the device determined was applicable. There can be multiple records for a device if it's discovered multiple applicable updates in the past 60 days. Use this table if you want to get detailed update status for your active deployments. There will typically be 3 update status records per device for the latest 3 security updates. UCUpdateAlert: Use this table to understand update failures and act on devices through alert recommendations. This table contains information that needs attention, relative to one device, one update, and one deployment (if relevant). Windows quality updates are monthly updates that arereleased on the second or fourth Tuesday of the month. The cumulative updates released on the second Tuesday of the month can contain both security updates and nonsecurity updates. Cumulative updates released on the fourth Tuesday of the month are optional nonsecurity preview releases. Use the fields within theUCClient tablefor additional information, such as: Once enrollment is done and devices are properly configured to share data, wait for 48 hours for data to start showing up in reports. It can take up to 14 days for all of your devices to show up in reports in some cases where devices aren't active much. You can check to see if the Log Analytics tables are being populated in your workspace. The data is ingested by the service daily to generate reports. If you notice a day is missing, it's possible that the reports service missed an ingestion. To confirm devices are sending data,querytheUCClient table. The following query shows total enrolled device count per time-generated: UCClient | summarize count() by TimeGenerated  If theUCClient tablehas data, but theworkbookisn't displaying data, ensure that the user has correct permissions to read the data. TheLog Analytics Readerrole is needed to view the data in the workbooks. TheLog Analytics Contributorrole is needed to do any edits to the queries and workbooks. Data is aggregated for the last 28 days for active devices. You may see data in the report listed as 'Unknown'. This status indicates that the Delivery Optimization DownloadMode setting is either invalid or empty. The top groups are represented by the number of devices in a particular group, for any of the four group types (GroupID, City, Country, and ISP). The GroupID values are encoded for data protection requirements. For more information, seeMapping GroupIDs. Today, we don't have a distinction for data that was downloaded by location. A row in UCDOStatus represents data downloaded by a combination of a single device ID (AzureADDeviceId) by content type (ContentType). A row in UCDOAggregatedStatus represents data summarized at the tenant level (AzureADTenantID) for each content type (ContentType). If there's a Connected Cache server at the ISP level, BytesFromCache filters out any bytes coming the ISP's Connected Cache. Delivery Optimization PowerShell cmdletscan be a powerful tool used to monitor Delivery Optimization data on the device. These cmdlets use the cache on the device. The data calculated in the report is taken from the Delivery Optimization events. The data in the report does represent the last 28 days of data. The query for last seven days is just to get the data for the latest snapshot from past seven days. It's possible that data is delayed for sometime and not available for current day, so we look for past seven day snapshot in log analytics and show the latest snapshot.

Why does the retention percentage sometimes fluctuate in the monthly waterfall view?,"Note the Cohort column. This tells you how many customers started using your offer in a month. If the column says 60 users in the cohort, then the percentage is calculated month-over-month by dividing the total number of users still using the offer by 60. If it's showing 35%, for example, that means 21 users are still using the offer. If the next month shows 40%, that means that three users came back (24/60).

These tables contain multiple records because they have the history for all devices that have discovered applicable updates within the past 28 days. For example, it's possible that a device has discovered multiple security updates, each with different update states, at various times over the past 28 days. It's also possible that a device can be in multiple deployments, so multiple records are displayed. An unknown client state is displayed if there isn't an update record for the device. This state can happen for many reasons, like the device not being active, not being able to scan Windows Update, or it doesn't currently have any update related activity occurring. The wordtargetin data labels refers to the update version, build, or KB the client intends to update to. Typically, the fields starting withOS, such as OSbuild and OSversion, represents what the device is currently running. These tables can be used for the following information: UCClient: Represents an individual device's record. It contains data such as the device's name, currently installed build, and the OS Edition. Each device has one record in this table. Use this table to get the overall compliance status of your devices. UCClientUpdateStatus: Contains records for every update the device determined was applicable. There can be multiple records for a device if it's discovered multiple applicable updates in the past 60 days. Use this table if you want to get detailed update status for your active deployments. There will typically be 3 update status records per device for the latest 3 security updates. UCUpdateAlert: Use this table to understand update failures and act on devices through alert recommendations. This table contains information that needs attention, relative to one device, one update, and one deployment (if relevant). Windows quality updates are monthly updates that arereleased on the second or fourth Tuesday of the month. The cumulative updates released on the second Tuesday of the month can contain both security updates and nonsecurity updates. Cumulative updates released on the fourth Tuesday of the month are optional nonsecurity preview releases. Use the fields within theUCClient tablefor additional information, such as: Once enrollment is done and devices are properly configured to share data, wait for 48 hours for data to start showing up in reports. It can take up to 14 days for all of your devices to show up in reports in some cases where devices aren't active much. You can check to see if the Log Analytics tables are being populated in your workspace. The data is ingested by the service daily to generate reports. If you notice a day is missing, it's possible that the reports service missed an ingestion. To confirm devices are sending data,querytheUCClient table. The following query shows total enrolled device count per time-generated: UCClient | summarize count() by TimeGenerated  If theUCClient tablehas data, but theworkbookisn't displaying data, ensure that the user has correct permissions to read the data. TheLog Analytics Readerrole is needed to view the data in the workbooks. TheLog Analytics Contributorrole is needed to do any edits to the queries and workbooks. Data is aggregated for the last 28 days for active devices. You may see data in the report listed as 'Unknown'. This status indicates that the Delivery Optimization DownloadMode setting is either invalid or empty. The top groups are represented by the number of devices in a particular group, for any of the four group types (GroupID, City, Country, and ISP). The GroupID values are encoded for data protection requirements. For more information, seeMapping GroupIDs. Today, we don't have a distinction for data that was downloaded by location. A row in UCDOStatus represents data downloaded by a combination of a single device ID (AzureADDeviceId) by content type (ContentType). A row in UCDOAggregatedStatus represents data summarized at the tenant level (AzureADTenantID) for each content type (ContentType). If there's a Connected Cache server at the ISP level, BytesFromCache filters out any bytes coming the ISP's Connected Cache. Delivery Optimization PowerShell cmdletscan be a powerful tool used to monitor Delivery Optimization data on the device. These cmdlets use the cache on the device. The data calculated in the report is taken from the Delivery Optimization events. The data in the report does represent the last 28 days of data. The query for last seven days is just to get the data for the latest snapshot from past seven days. It's possible that data is delayed for sometime and not available for current day, so we look for past seven day snapshot in log analytics and show the latest snapshot.

How do you define a customer?,A customer is one billing account ID.,"This article addresses frequently asked questions about private offers from independent software vendors (ISVs) to customers in Partner Center. Private offers let you transact private deals with your customers in the commercial marketplace. This new feature supports many new capabilities and addresses limitations associated with private plans. You can use it to:  * Requires a publicly transactable offer in the marketplace. You can create private offers for all transactable offer types: SaaS, Azure VM, Azure container and Azure application. Private offers aren't currently available in Microsoft AppSource. On thePrivate offersdashboard, you can: To offer your employees free access to your products by using the marketplace: After you finish these steps, Microsoft charges only the infrastructure cost for any usage or subscription on that billing account. To create a private offer, you need the billing account ID of your customer. Billing account information is available only to customers. Publishers can't access it. Customers can find the billing account information in the Azure portal by going toCost Management + Billing>Settings>Properties. Or, if a customer knows the subscription that they plan to use for the purchase, they can find their billing account information in the Azure portal by selectingSubscriptions, selecting the relevant subscription, and then going toProperties(orBilling Properties). To access this information, the customer must be an owner or contributor on the billing account. If a customer doesn't have a billing account, they can create one by signing up on Azure.com. SeeBilling account scopes in the Azure portal. With the private offer applied at the level of the billing account ID, if new subscriptions are added to the customer's Azure plan, the private offer automatically applies to those subscriptions. You don't need to make edits to the private offer. While you're creating a new private offer, selectAccepted dateas the start date to make the price available for the customer to transact as soon as the private offer is accepted. ChooseSpecific monthto make the private price available in a future calendar month. For example: If you create a private offer on May 15 and want the private price to be available to the customer on June 1, selectJune. The private offer starts on the first day of the month and ends on the last day. You can't select specific start and end dates. If the customer purchases the public offer or plan before June 1, they won't receive the private offer price for any transactions before June 1. The time zone for the start date is Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Note If a private offer is extended to an existing customer of pay-as-you-go consumption-based products like virtual machines, selectingAccepted datemakes the private price applicable for the entire month. For example: If you create a private offer on May 15 for a virtual machine product and selectAccepted date, the private price will apply for the entire month of acceptance. TheAccept bydate is the private offer's expiration date. Your customer must accept the private offer before the end of this date or the private offer expires.End datespecifies the date on which the private price and terms end. The time zone for the accept-by date and the end date is UTC. You can document and upload custom terms and conditions that you and the customer agreed upon as part of the private deal. The customer is required to legally accept these terms and conditions as part of accepting the private offer. Uploading custom terms and conditions is optional in a private offer. You can upload only one document, and it must be in PDF format. Custom terms and conditions between you and the customer shouldn't violate any terms in the Microsoft Publisher Agreement. It depends. If you want to use the public terms of use for the private offer with no changes, you can skip uploading any custom terms and conditions to the private offer. Public terms of use are presented to the customer during purchase of the private offer. If you want to amend the public terms for the private offer, you need to upload custom terms and conditions to the private offer. Custom terms and conditions are presented to the customer during purchase of the private offer. You can use a discounted price to provide a percentage-based discount on top of a publicly listed plan. You can specify a discounted price only when the private price is lower than the publicly listed plan price. You can use an absolute price to specify a price point that's higher, lower, or equal to the publicly listed plan price. You can apply an absolute price only at a plan level. You can't apply an absolute price for VM offer types or any plans that have a trial enabled. The clone option creates an editable copy of an existing private offer that you can publish as a new private offer. You can use cloning on any private offer, regardless of its status. You can upgrade an existing private offer that a customer accepted. The marketplace supports upgrades only at renewal. For example, the upgraded offer's start and end date can't overlap with the existing private offer. You can edit only pricing, dates, terms, and notification contacts for the upgraded private offer. If you need other changes, create a new private offer. You can't change a private offer in aPending Acceptancestate. If the customer hasn't accepted the private offer, you can withdraw the offer from the customer to make changes. After you withdraw a private offer, your customer can't access it unless you resubmit it to the customer. Private offers created undercustomize pricing for existing public offers and plansmust be unique and not overlap with another customer private offer or multiparty private offer for the same customer billing account ID, using the same base public plan, with overlapping private offer start and end dates. Overlapping private offers are blocked at submission in Partner Center. To remedy this conflict, you have several options depending on whether the customer has already accepted the private offer.  Note For private offers published before 2025 with the same customer billing account ID, same product plan(s), and overlapping private offer start and end dates, the price is determined as follows: Partner Center uses theNotification Contactsinformation to notify you of changes to the private offer status. The notification email is sent when the private offer status changes fromIn ProgresstoPending Acceptance,Pending AcceptancetoAccepted, orPending AcceptancetoExpired. No, Microsoft doesn't send any notifications to the customer. You should copy the private offer link and send it to the customer for acceptance. No. You're notified via the SaaS fulfillment API that a SaaS offer is activated but not that it has an associated private offer. You can see if the customer accepted a private offer in theInsightsreporting. You can't upgrade a private offer during the offer's term. You can create an upgrade at any time and a customer could accept it, but the upgrade takes effect only at the end of the existing private offer. Use theUpgradefeature to extend the start and end date and to include revised custom terms and conditions associated with the private offer. To add or remove offers and plans, create a new private offer. Any user within the customer's organization can see the details of a private offer. To accept a private offer, the user in the customer organization needs to be an owner, contributor, or admin on the billing account. Without appropriate permissions, the user can't accept the private offer. To get access to the billing account, the user should contact the admin or owner. A red notice at the top of the page indicates three people in the customer's organization who have the appropriate permissions. After a private offer is accepted, it's a legal agreement between you and the customer, so it can't be changed. If the private offer is due to begin on the accepted date, the customer can go to the Azure portal to subscribe to the offer by using any Azure subscription associated with the billing account. The customer must use an Azure subscription associated with the configured billing account to get the private price. If the private offer includes pay-as-you-go offers (virtual machines) and was extended to an existing customer, the customer is charged at the private price as soon as the private offer is accepted. For a private offer that includes SaaS, the customer must subscribe to the SaaS product and then configure the product within 30 days of subscribing to it. If you configured the private offer to begin at a future date, your customer could accept the private offer before the accept-by date but should not complete the purchase until after the private offer's start date. After the customer accepts the private offer, it can take up to 15 minutes for the private price to appear in the marketplace on the product details page. If the customer transacts within these 15 minutes, the marketplace still charges the customer correctly by using the private price. Accepting a private offer doesn't initiate billing. To complete the purchase, customers must subscribe to the SaaS product or deploy the virtual machine or Azure application product within the private offer in the Azure portal. For a private offer that includes a SaaS product, the customer must also configure the product within 30 days of subscribing to it. If the customer chose automatic renewal, and you don't create a new private offer that the customer accepts, the customer is charged the list price of the public plan. Yes. Customers who have a Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment can decrement it for benefit-eligible purchases through customer private offers. Customers can't decrement their Azure Consumption Commitment for product purchases through CSP private offers. There are no changes in the payout experience for private offers. After a customer transacts by using private offers, the transaction details appear on theEarningspage in Partner Center. In theInsightsworkspace, you can filter theOrdersandUsagereports by private offers and public offers. You should use private offers for your negotiated deals on Azure Marketplace. Private plans continue to be supported and can be used for specific scenarios. For example, you can use a private plan if you want to use a private (custom) VM image for your customer as part of the private deal or if it meets requirements for their specific use case. To use private offers, ISVs must have publicly transactable plans published to Azure Marketplace. We don't recommend that you have both a private plan and a private offer for the same customer, product, and time period. Private plans can continue to exist for existing deals, and you can use private offers for new deals. Move customers to private offers as each customer's private plan term comes up for renewal or expiration. You can create a private offer that will begin at the end of the current subscription term for the private plan. After your customers accept the private offer, they need to subscribe to the plan that your private offer contains. You can also move your customers to private offers in the middle of a private plan term. If a customer paid for the full term of the original private plan, create a private offer and set the customer price to $0 or apply a 100% discount to your retail price. Your customer then needs to accept the private offer terms and subscribe to the products within the private offer. Private offers support monthly, annual, two-year, or three-year terms. If your customer has a remaining duration that's different from these terms, it's best for the customer to complete the private plan term before subscribing to a private offer. For example, if your customer is in year two of a three-year private plan term and is due to pay for a third year, you can create a private offer for a one-year duration to charge the customer's final year via a private offer. Your customer then needs to cancel the original subscription to the private plan to avoid being charged as part of renewing the private plan. You can then stop-sell the private plan.

After a customer transacts by using private offers, the transaction details appear on theEarningspage in Partner Center. In theInsightsworkspace, you can filter theOrdersandUsagereports by private offers and public offers. You should use private offers for your negotiated deals on Azure Marketplace. Private plans continue to be supported and can be used for specific scenarios. For example, you can use a private plan if you want to use a private (custom) VM image for your customer as part of the private deal or if it meets requirements for their specific use case. To use private offers, ISVs must have publicly transactable plans published to Azure Marketplace. We don't recommend that you have both a private plan and a private offer for the same customer, product, and time period. Private plans can continue to exist for existing deals, and you can use private offers for new deals. Move customers to private offers as each customer's private plan term comes up for renewal or expiration. You can create a private offer that will begin at the end of the current subscription term for the private plan. After your customers accept the private offer, they need to subscribe to the plan that your private offer contains. You can also move your customers to private offers in the middle of a private plan term. If a customer paid for the full term of the original private plan, create a private offer and set the customer price to $0 or apply a 100% discount to your retail price. Your customer then needs to accept the private offer terms and subscribe to the products within the private offer. Private offers support monthly, annual, two-year, or three-year terms. If your customer has a remaining duration that's different from these terms, it's best for the customer to complete the private plan term before subscribing to a private offer. For example, if your customer is in year two of a three-year private plan term and is due to pay for a third year, you can create a private offer for a one-year duration to charge the customer's final year via a private offer. Your customer then needs to cancel the original subscription to the private plan to avoid being charged as part of renewing the private plan. You can then stop-sell the private plan.

Can I see this data quarterly?,"There's no quarterly filter. However, looking at the monthly view will help you see patterns over a quarterly time frame.","This article answers frequently asked questions about Windows Update for Business reports. General questions: Setup questions: Questions about using Windows Update for Business reports: Delivery Optimization data: Windows Update for Business reports is a cloud-based solution that provides information about your Microsoft Entra joined devices' compliance with Windows updates. Windows Update for Business reports is offered through theAzure portal, and it's included as part of the Windows 10 or Windows 11 prerequisite licenses. Data ingested into your Log Analytics workspace can be retained at no charge for up to first 31 days (or 90 days ifMicrosoft Sentinelis enabled on the workspace). Data ingested intoApplication Insights, either classic or workspace-based, is retained for 90 days without any charge.
Data retained beyond these no-charge periods are charged for each GB of data retained for a month, pro-rated daily. For more information, seeLog Data RetentioninAzure Monitor pricing. Windows Update for Business reports supports clients running asupported version of Windows 10 or Windows 11Professional, Education, Enterprise, and Enterprise multi-session editions. Windows Update for Business reports only provides data for the standard Desktop Windows client version and isn't currently compatible with Windows Server, Surface Hub, IoT, or other versions. Important Currently there is a known issue where Windows Update for Business reports doesn't display data for Enterprise multi-session edition devices. After verifying theprerequisitesare met, you can start to set up Windows Update for Business reports.
The two main steps for setting up  Windows Update for Business reports are: Typically, theWaiting for Windows Update for Business reports datamessage is displayed because: A400 Bad Request: The specified resource already existserror message indicates that the service already has a subscription and workspace mapping saved. If you're trying to re-enroll with the same configuration settings, wait a few minutes, then refresh the page before saving your subscription and workspace again. Sometimes it can take time to register the save, so it's important to not re-enroll too quickly. If you're seeing the device ID but not the device name, it's possible that the required policy for displaying the device name isn't set on the client. Ensure clients have the policy configured. Here are some reasons why you may not be seeing devices in reports: Devices have multiple records when theUCClientUpdateStatusorUCClientServiceStatustables are queried. These tables contain multiple records because they have the history for all devices that have discovered applicable updates within the past 28 days. For example, it's possible that a device has discovered multiple security updates, each with different update states, at various times over the past 28 days. It's also possible that a device can be in multiple deployments, so multiple records are displayed. An unknown client state is displayed if there isn't an update record for the device. This state can happen for many reasons, like the device not being active, not being able to scan Windows Update, or it doesn't currently have any update related activity occurring. The wordtargetin data labels refers to the update version, build, or KB the client intends to update to. Typically, the fields starting withOS, such as OSbuild and OSversion, represents what the device is currently running. These tables can be used for the following information: UCClient: Represents an individual device's record. It contains data such as the device's name, currently installed build, and the OS Edition. Each device has one record in this table. Use this table to get the overall compliance status of your devices. UCClientUpdateStatus: Contains records for every update the device determined was applicable. There can be multiple records for a device if it's discovered multiple applicable updates in the past 60 days. Use this table if you want to get detailed update status for your active deployments. There will typically be 3 update status records per device for the latest 3 security updates. UCUpdateAlert: Use this table to understand update failures and act on devices through alert recommendations. This table contains information that needs attention, relative to one device, one update, and one deployment (if relevant). Windows quality updates are monthly updates that arereleased on the second or fourth Tuesday of the month. The cumulative updates released on the second Tuesday of the month can contain both security updates and nonsecurity updates. Cumulative updates released on the fourth Tuesday of the month are optional nonsecurity preview releases. Use the fields within theUCClient tablefor additional information, such as: Once enrollment is done and devices are properly configured to share data, wait for 48 hours for data to start showing up in reports. It can take up to 14 days for all of your devices to show up in reports in some cases where devices aren't active much. You can check to see if the Log Analytics tables are being populated in your workspace. The data is ingested by the service daily to generate reports. If you notice a day is missing, it's possible that the reports service missed an ingestion. To confirm devices are sending data,querytheUCClient table. The following query shows total enrolled device count per time-generated: UCClient | summarize count() by TimeGenerated  If theUCClient tablehas data, but theworkbookisn't displaying data, ensure that the user has correct permissions to read the data. TheLog Analytics Readerrole is needed to view the data in the workbooks. TheLog Analytics Contributorrole is needed to do any edits to the queries and workbooks. Data is aggregated for the last 28 days for active devices. You may see data in the report listed as 'Unknown'. This status indicates that the Delivery Optimization DownloadMode setting is either invalid or empty. The top groups are represented by the number of devices in a particular group, for any of the four group types (GroupID, City, Country, and ISP). The GroupID values are encoded for data protection requirements. For more information, seeMapping GroupIDs. Today, we don't have a distinction for data that was downloaded by location. A row in UCDOStatus represents data downloaded by a combination of a single device ID (AzureADDeviceId) by content type (ContentType). A row in UCDOAggregatedStatus represents data summarized at the tenant level (AzureADTenantID) for each content type (ContentType). If there's a Connected Cache server at the ISP level, BytesFromCache filters out any bytes coming the ISP's Connected Cache. Delivery Optimization PowerShell cmdletscan be a powerful tool used to monitor Delivery Optimization data on the device. These cmdlets use the cache on the device. The data calculated in the report is taken from the Delivery Optimization events. The data in the report does represent the last 28 days of data. The query for last seven days is just to get the data for the latest snapshot from past seven days. It's possible that data is delayed for sometime and not available for current day, so we look for past seven day snapshot in log analytics and show the latest snapshot.

Do these views filter out internal users from my company who might be testing the offer?,"No, the only identifier available for these users would be email domain; we can't know with confidence whether or not they're internal to your company.","This article addresses frequently asked questions about private offers from independent software vendors (ISVs) to customers in Partner Center. Private offers let you transact private deals with your customers in the commercial marketplace. This new feature supports many new capabilities and addresses limitations associated with private plans. You can use it to:  * Requires a publicly transactable offer in the marketplace. You can create private offers for all transactable offer types: SaaS, Azure VM, Azure container and Azure application. Private offers aren't currently available in Microsoft AppSource. On thePrivate offersdashboard, you can: To offer your employees free access to your products by using the marketplace: After you finish these steps, Microsoft charges only the infrastructure cost for any usage or subscription on that billing account. To create a private offer, you need the billing account ID of your customer. Billing account information is available only to customers. Publishers can't access it. Customers can find the billing account information in the Azure portal by going toCost Management + Billing>Settings>Properties. Or, if a customer knows the subscription that they plan to use for the purchase, they can find their billing account information in the Azure portal by selectingSubscriptions, selecting the relevant subscription, and then going toProperties(orBilling Properties). To access this information, the customer must be an owner or contributor on the billing account. If a customer doesn't have a billing account, they can create one by signing up on Azure.com. SeeBilling account scopes in the Azure portal. With the private offer applied at the level of the billing account ID, if new subscriptions are added to the customer's Azure plan, the private offer automatically applies to those subscriptions. You don't need to make edits to the private offer. While you're creating a new private offer, selectAccepted dateas the start date to make the price available for the customer to transact as soon as the private offer is accepted. ChooseSpecific monthto make the private price available in a future calendar month. For example: If you create a private offer on May 15 and want the private price to be available to the customer on June 1, selectJune. The private offer starts on the first day of the month and ends on the last day. You can't select specific start and end dates. If the customer purchases the public offer or plan before June 1, they won't receive the private offer price for any transactions before June 1. The time zone for the start date is Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Note If a private offer is extended to an existing customer of pay-as-you-go consumption-based products like virtual machines, selectingAccepted datemakes the private price applicable for the entire month. For example: If you create a private offer on May 15 for a virtual machine product and selectAccepted date, the private price will apply for the entire month of acceptance. TheAccept bydate is the private offer's expiration date. Your customer must accept the private offer before the end of this date or the private offer expires.End datespecifies the date on which the private price and terms end. The time zone for the accept-by date and the end date is UTC. You can document and upload custom terms and conditions that you and the customer agreed upon as part of the private deal. The customer is required to legally accept these terms and conditions as part of accepting the private offer. Uploading custom terms and conditions is optional in a private offer. You can upload only one document, and it must be in PDF format. Custom terms and conditions between you and the customer shouldn't violate any terms in the Microsoft Publisher Agreement. It depends. If you want to use the public terms of use for the private offer with no changes, you can skip uploading any custom terms and conditions to the private offer. Public terms of use are presented to the customer during purchase of the private offer. If you want to amend the public terms for the private offer, you need to upload custom terms and conditions to the private offer. Custom terms and conditions are presented to the customer during purchase of the private offer. You can use a discounted price to provide a percentage-based discount on top of a publicly listed plan. You can specify a discounted price only when the private price is lower than the publicly listed plan price. You can use an absolute price to specify a price point that's higher, lower, or equal to the publicly listed plan price. You can apply an absolute price only at a plan level. You can't apply an absolute price for VM offer types or any plans that have a trial enabled. The clone option creates an editable copy of an existing private offer that you can publish as a new private offer. You can use cloning on any private offer, regardless of its status. You can upgrade an existing private offer that a customer accepted. The marketplace supports upgrades only at renewal. For example, the upgraded offer's start and end date can't overlap with the existing private offer. You can edit only pricing, dates, terms, and notification contacts for the upgraded private offer. If you need other changes, create a new private offer. You can't change a private offer in aPending Acceptancestate. If the customer hasn't accepted the private offer, you can withdraw the offer from the customer to make changes. After you withdraw a private offer, your customer can't access it unless you resubmit it to the customer. Private offers created undercustomize pricing for existing public offers and plansmust be unique and not overlap with another customer private offer or multiparty private offer for the same customer billing account ID, using the same base public plan, with overlapping private offer start and end dates. Overlapping private offers are blocked at submission in Partner Center. To remedy this conflict, you have several options depending on whether the customer has already accepted the private offer.  Note For private offers published before 2025 with the same customer billing account ID, same product plan(s), and overlapping private offer start and end dates, the price is determined as follows: Partner Center uses theNotification Contactsinformation to notify you of changes to the private offer status. The notification email is sent when the private offer status changes fromIn ProgresstoPending Acceptance,Pending AcceptancetoAccepted, orPending AcceptancetoExpired. No, Microsoft doesn't send any notifications to the customer. You should copy the private offer link and send it to the customer for acceptance. No. You're notified via the SaaS fulfillment API that a SaaS offer is activated but not that it has an associated private offer. You can see if the customer accepted a private offer in theInsightsreporting. You can't upgrade a private offer during the offer's term. You can create an upgrade at any time and a customer could accept it, but the upgrade takes effect only at the end of the existing private offer. Use theUpgradefeature to extend the start and end date and to include revised custom terms and conditions associated with the private offer. To add or remove offers and plans, create a new private offer. Any user within the customer's organization can see the details of a private offer. To accept a private offer, the user in the customer organization needs to be an owner, contributor, or admin on the billing account. Without appropriate permissions, the user can't accept the private offer. To get access to the billing account, the user should contact the admin or owner. A red notice at the top of the page indicates three people in the customer's organization who have the appropriate permissions. After a private offer is accepted, it's a legal agreement between you and the customer, so it can't be changed. If the private offer is due to begin on the accepted date, the customer can go to the Azure portal to subscribe to the offer by using any Azure subscription associated with the billing account. The customer must use an Azure subscription associated with the configured billing account to get the private price. If the private offer includes pay-as-you-go offers (virtual machines) and was extended to an existing customer, the customer is charged at the private price as soon as the private offer is accepted. For a private offer that includes SaaS, the customer must subscribe to the SaaS product and then configure the product within 30 days of subscribing to it. If you configured the private offer to begin at a future date, your customer could accept the private offer before the accept-by date but should not complete the purchase until after the private offer's start date. After the customer accepts the private offer, it can take up to 15 minutes for the private price to appear in the marketplace on the product details page. If the customer transacts within these 15 minutes, the marketplace still charges the customer correctly by using the private price. Accepting a private offer doesn't initiate billing. To complete the purchase, customers must subscribe to the SaaS product or deploy the virtual machine or Azure application product within the private offer in the Azure portal. For a private offer that includes a SaaS product, the customer must also configure the product within 30 days of subscribing to it. If the customer chose automatic renewal, and you don't create a new private offer that the customer accepts, the customer is charged the list price of the public plan. Yes. Customers who have a Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment can decrement it for benefit-eligible purchases through customer private offers. Customers can't decrement their Azure Consumption Commitment for product purchases through CSP private offers. There are no changes in the payout experience for private offers. After a customer transacts by using private offers, the transaction details appear on theEarningspage in Partner Center. In theInsightsworkspace, you can filter theOrdersandUsagereports by private offers and public offers. You should use private offers for your negotiated deals on Azure Marketplace. Private plans continue to be supported and can be used for specific scenarios. For example, you can use a private plan if you want to use a private (custom) VM image for your customer as part of the private deal or if it meets requirements for their specific use case. To use private offers, ISVs must have publicly transactable plans published to Azure Marketplace. We don't recommend that you have both a private plan and a private offer for the same customer, product, and time period. Private plans can continue to exist for existing deals, and you can use private offers for new deals. Move customers to private offers as each customer's private plan term comes up for renewal or expiration. You can create a private offer that will begin at the end of the current subscription term for the private plan. After your customers accept the private offer, they need to subscribe to the plan that your private offer contains. You can also move your customers to private offers in the middle of a private plan term. If a customer paid for the full term of the original private plan, create a private offer and set the customer price to $0 or apply a 100% discount to your retail price. Your customer then needs to accept the private offer terms and subscribe to the products within the private offer. Private offers support monthly, annual, two-year, or three-year terms. If your customer has a remaining duration that's different from these terms, it's best for the customer to complete the private plan term before subscribing to a private offer. For example, if your customer is in year two of a three-year private plan term and is due to pay for a third year, you can create a private offer for a one-year duration to charge the customer's final year via a private offer. Your customer then needs to cancel the original subscription to the private plan to avoid being charged as part of renewing the private plan. You can then stop-sell the private plan.

To complete the purchase, customers must subscribe to the SaaS product or deploy the virtual machine or Azure application product within the private offer in the Azure portal. For a private offer that includes a SaaS product, the customer must also configure the product within 30 days of subscribing to it. If the customer chose automatic renewal, and you don't create a new private offer that the customer accepts, the customer is charged the list price of the public plan. Yes. Customers who have a Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment can decrement it for benefit-eligible purchases through customer private offers. Customers can't decrement their Azure Consumption Commitment for product purchases through CSP private offers. There are no changes in the payout experience for private offers. After a customer transacts by using private offers, the transaction details appear on theEarningspage in Partner Center. In theInsightsworkspace, you can filter theOrdersandUsagereports by private offers and public offers. You should use private offers for your negotiated deals on Azure Marketplace. Private plans continue to be supported and can be used for specific scenarios. For example, you can use a private plan if you want to use a private (custom) VM image for your customer as part of the private deal or if it meets requirements for their specific use case. To use private offers, ISVs must have publicly transactable plans published to Azure Marketplace. We don't recommend that you have both a private plan and a private offer for the same customer, product, and time period. Private plans can continue to exist for existing deals, and you can use private offers for new deals. Move customers to private offers as each customer's private plan term comes up for renewal or expiration. You can create a private offer that will begin at the end of the current subscription term for the private plan. After your customers accept the private offer, they need to subscribe to the plan that your private offer contains. You can also move your customers to private offers in the middle of a private plan term. If a customer paid for the full term of the original private plan, create a private offer and set the customer price to $0 or apply a 100% discount to your retail price. Your customer then needs to accept the private offer terms and subscribe to the products within the private offer. Private offers support monthly, annual, two-year, or three-year terms. If your customer has a remaining duration that's different from these terms, it's best for the customer to complete the private plan term before subscribing to a private offer. For example, if your customer is in year two of a three-year private plan term and is due to pay for a third year, you can create a private offer for a one-year duration to charge the customer's final year via a private offer. Your customer then needs to cancel the original subscription to the private plan to avoid being charged as part of renewing the private plan. You can then stop-sell the private plan.

There is a separateFAQ wikithat Partner can share with their Customers post-production. - Integration Phase - Data Privacy - Customer Setup - Product Functionality: One-Click Export - Product Functionality: Misc - Certification Please referenceRSC developer documentation Reach out to LinkedIn Business Development to fill out the Onboarding Request Form and follow steps in theRSC developer documentation. New Talent Solutions integrations like Recruiter System Connect are built on the Middleware Platform, which means you should manage job applications via the /atsApplications and  /atsCandidates endpoint instead of /simpleJobApplications. If youâ€™ve previously integrated with LinkedIn Referrals, youâ€™ll need to switch to using the Middleware Platform for submitting job applications. No. The minimum product and technical requirements for RSC are indicated in this document and partners may not elect to enable a subset. We require all historical candidate, applications, and jobs records to ensure LinkedIn Recruiter is as valuable as possible for your customers [i.e. the â€œRediscovered Candidatesâ€ Spotlight, â€˜In-ATS Indicatorâ€™] Many customers will not need to do so if their privacy policies allows them to share candidate data to their third party partners. However, customers will need to consult their own legal teams regarding this prior to activating RSC. Some partners include a disclaimer in the onboarding widget that requires the customer to authorize the sharing of ATS data with LinkedIn. Customers will be able to turn on all their middleware integrations via a widget in the ATS and in their Recruiter dashboard. Seetechnical docs Customers must email the Partner and LinkedIn support notifying us they would like to deactivate RSC. Customer can contact LinkedIn support at ltsatsintegrations@linkedin.com Rcorp (Recruiter Corporate), RPS (Recruiter Professional Services), and Recruiter SMB The ATS partner can confirm the duplication was handled in the ATS when LI passes back the PersonURN (Member ID) to the ATS Partner LinkedIn members that don't have their privacy settings set to share their profile with third parties will not have One-Click Export functionality enabled. Customer can create a standard ""dummy req"" field in the drop down that Recruiter will be able to export the candidate to if they do not want to associate the candidate with a Job Req. ATS can then conduct any matching required on their end. However, customers will need to consult their legal team to determine if they can export data unassociated with a requisition. Yes it will show all open jobs that the user has permissions to see based on Security Groups. If a Partner has not enabled Security Groups, all open jobs will be seen by all users. Customers can search for jobs based on type head Call volume for One-Click Export is 300 calls per Recruiter seat per month. LinkedIn reserves the right to change rate limits including to prevent abuse and protect privacy and security. ATS will validate this push event against the signature in the request, outlined in ourdocumentation. This is an expected behavior, whencompanyJobCodeexist, it takes precedence overexternalJobPostingId LI will post jobs based on the language that the customer posts in. If the job requires multiple languages, the customer should have separate listings for each language. The preferred integration is to send in real-time Jobs will default to 180 days if there is no expiration date passed in. For jobs with multiple locations, the current solution is to post one requisition per location. Or, send only the primary location if that designation exists.
For jobs with no location (e.g. virtual jobs), you may either: Not send these jobs, or Default to a specific location (for example, headquarter). Jobs will not be posted without a location No, the way the middleware platform is architected, it needs to be through the Simple Job Posting API. Yes, LinkedIn integrations are set up at the contract level, so customers can have separate integrations for any of their contracts. Recruiter users can switch between contracts, and each contract can be associated with one or more integrations.
Partners must be able to support multiple contracts for the same customer. There is an â€œSend InMailâ€ button in the profile widget that allows sending InMails. It sends a notification to the ATS user in LinkedIn Recruiter when there are profile updates for the relevant candidate. If a candidate deletes their LinkedIn account, they can reactivate it within 21 days. After 21 days, we purge the deleted accounts and populate that information within theClosed Candidates Endpoint. Our ATS partners must query this endpoint periodically (at least once in 30 days) and purge the accounts (that appear within this endpoint) from their records. When an API Job is designated asBasic, either by creating a new Basic API Job or by inline downgrading aPremiumAPI Job, it will be visible in the RSC 1CE (one click export).
Inline upgrading aBasicAPI Job to aPremiumJob does not change its visibility in the RSC 1CE; the job remains visible until it is closed.
Similarly, inline downgrading aPremiumAPI Job to aBasicJob will make the job appear in the RSC 1CE. No updates to an API Job, except for theCLOSEaction, are sent to the RSC.
We will implement a change, once ready, where public and private jobs will be synchronized separately. Until your integration aligns with this update, the above recommendation applies to your ATS. Yes, it's an all-or-nothing integration (with the exception of the feature that enables the sending of Interview Notes and Feedback to LinkedIn Recruiter, which is optional) ; however partners can test and certify each module along the way prior to launch. The requirements are laid out in thedeveloperandrequired fieldsdocumentation. First name and last name are used as part of our matching algorithm, though the fields are optional. The preference would be to split firstName and lastName if you have it The throttling is based on the number of API calls being made. We don't have any maximum limits of how much data can be synced by customers. The Sync API will consider any data after the initial push as an update.  As long as you are sending the correct fields and values against it, there should be no problem. This varies across our ATS partners, however we generally see this reflected within a few minutes. Ideally this should be as real-time as possible. Yes, the button should show up if there was a network error. Once the request is sent, the button changes to Notify Partner, after this you should be able to call /atsIntegrationsAPI. People are matched on the basis of email first and then phone number, subject to the relevant memberâ€™s privacy settings. If the matching made is incorrect or cannot be found, LinkedIn allows the Customer to manually match in the Profile Widget. Refer to thisAPI. This updates the 'manualMatchedMember' attribute for synced candidates. It is advised that if the value for the manualMatchedMember field is present then ATS should always use that instead of the values present in the 'matchedMembers' attribute. The jobs are sent in a sequence and also returned back in a sequence. So you would be keeping track of the sequence and able to match it accordingly. No. The minimum character length is to ensure this is a genuine job and not spam. We accept only quality jobs so that is why we have the restriction. If the description is within 10K characters, this should be fine. Within the widget there is a callback function parameter which on link / unlink allows your system to add or update the appropriate person URN to update and store. The person URN connects the candidate to the job post and all other information related to the candidate including notes, job application status, etc. Usein.parse()to reload the widget on a single page application. The Linkedin LTS Partner Operations (PO) team proactively renews contracts. This is a monthly activity and we renew your contract once its near expiry. This gives a seamless LinkedIn RSC experience without the need to raise a ticket for contract renewal. It is recommended to test the InMail functionality for RSC Integrations by sending InMails to your first degree connections. One can send unlimited inMails because there is no restriction to it. To be able to test this feature, the users should be connected to the developers of our team. Through ACL, we control the visibility of any jobs to only user(s). ACLs consist of two parts -atsEntityAclsfor groups andatsEntityAclAssigneesfor members who can view the jobs.

Is the CSV upload feature still supported?,"Yes. For more information about using the .csv file upload feature, see  this PowerShell sample .","This article contains answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs) about usingStorage Migration Serviceto migrate servers. Storage Migration Service won't transfer files or folders that we know could interfere with Windows operation. Specifically, here's what we won't transfer or move into the PreExistingData folder on the destination: The Storage Migration Service doesn't migrate files that applications exclusively lock. The service does automatically retry three times with a sixty-second delay between tries, and you can control the number of attempts and the delay. You can also rerun transfers to copy just the files that were previously skipped due to sharing violations. The Storage Migration Service doesn't allow migrating between Active Directory domains. Migrations between servers will always join the destination server to the same domain. You can use migration credentials from different domains in the Active Directory forest. The Storage Migration Service does support migrating between workgroups. You can't migrate NetAPP CIFS instances that aren't domain joined. The Storage Migration Service supports migrating the file server cluster resources from and to clusters. This includes migrating the file server resources from a source cluster to a destination cluster and migrating a standalone source server to a destination cluster file server resource for device consolidation purposes. You can't, however, migrate a cluster to a standalone server. You can migrate from Samba and NetApp CIFS servers to clusters. The Storage Migration Service does not migrate the cluster itself, it only migrates the file server cluster resources that represent file servers in a cluster. The Storage Migration Service supports migrating to Windows Server 2025, Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, and Windows Failover Clusters running those operating systems. It doesn't support migration to Samba, NetApp, or Azure Files. The Storage Migration Services does support migration to a Windows Server or cluster running Azure File Sync with cloud tiering when using the latest version of Windows Admin Center and Windows Server 2025, Windows Server 2022, or Windows Server 2019 after installation of cumulative updateKB5006744. The Storage Migration Service supports migrating local users and groups after installation of cumulative updateKB4513534or subsequent updates. It doesn't support migrating local users and groups from NetApp CIFS servers. The Storage Migration Service doesn't migrate domain controllers. As a workaround, as long as you have more than one domain controller in the Active Directory domain, demote the domain controller before migrating it, then promote the destination after cut over completes. If you do choose to migrate a domain controller source or destination, you won't be able to cut over. You must never migrate users and groups when migrating from or to a domain controller. Storage Migration Service migrates all flags, settings, and security of SMB shares. That list of flags that Storage Migration Service migrates includes: The Storage Migration Service doesn't support consolidating multiple servers into one server. An example of consolidation would be migrating three separate source servers - which may have the same share names and local file paths - onto a single new server that virtualized those paths and shares to prevent any overlap or collision, then answered all three previous servers names and IP address. You can migrate standalone servers onto multiple file server resources on a single cluster, and this is the recommended way to consolidate servers. The Storage Migration Service supports migrating from Samba Linux servers after installation of cumulative updateKB4513534or subsequent updates. See the requirements for a list of supported Samba versions and Linux distros. The Storage Migration Service supports migrating from NetApp FAS arrays after installation of cumulative updateKB5001384. The Storage Migration Service version doesn't support migrating Previous Versions (made with the volume shadow copy service) of files. Only the current version migrates. The Storage Migration Service contains a multi-threaded read and copy engine called the Storage Migration Service Proxy service, which we designed to be both fast and bring along perfect data fidelity lacking in many file copy tools. While the default configuration will be optimal for many customers, there are ways to improve SMS performance during inventory and transfer. Use Windows Server 2019 or later for the destination operating system.Windows Server 2019 and later contain the Storage Migration Service Proxy service. When you install this feature and migrate to Windows Server 2019 or later destinations, all transfers operate as direct line of sight between source and destination. This service runs on the orchestrator during transfer if the destination computers are Windows Server 2012 R2 or Windows Server 2016, which means the transfers double-hop and will be slower. If there are multiple jobs running with Windows Server 2012 R2 or Windows Server 2016 destinations, the orchestrator will become a bottleneck. The latest version of Windows Admin Center automatically configures the proxy service if not installed. Install latest monthly Cumulative Update.We have improved the Storage Migration Service Proxy service in several updates for better transfer and retransfer performance, and Inventory performance. InstallKB4580390 October 2020 Cumulative Updateor later to gain significant speed improvements, or migrate using Windows Server 2022. Alter default transfer threads.The Storage Migration Service Proxy service copies eight files simultaneously in a given job. You can increase the number of simultaneous copy threads by adjusting the following registry REG_DWORD value name in decimal on every node running the Storage Migration Service Proxy: HKEY_Local_Machine\Software\Microsoft\SMSProxy FileTransferThreadCount The valid range is 1 to 512. You don't need to restart the service to start using this setting as long as you create a new job. Use caution with this setting; setting it higher may require more cores, storage performance, and network bandwidth. Setting it too high may lead to reduced performance compared to default settings. Alter default parallel share threads.The Storage Migration Service Proxy service copies from eight shares simultaneously in a given job. You can increase the number of simultaneous share threads by adjusting the following registry REG_DWORD value name in decimal on the Storage Migration Service orchestrator server: HKEY_Local_Machine\Software\Microsoft\SMS EndpointFileTransferTaskCount The valid range is 1 to 512. You don't need to restart the service to start using this setting as long as you create a new job. Use caution with this setting; setting it higher may require more cores, storage performance, and network bandwidth. Setting it too high may lead to reduced performance compared to default settings. The sum of FileTransferThreadCount and EndpointFileTransferTaskCount is how many files the Storage Migration Service can simultaneously copy from one source node in a job. To add more parallel source nodes, create and run more simultaneous jobs. Add cores and memory.We strongly recommend that the source, orchestrator, and destination computers have at least two processor cores or two vCPUs, and more can significantly aid inventory and transfer performance, especially when combined with FileTransferThreadCount (above). When transferring files that are larger than the usual Office formats (gigabytes or greater) transfer performance will benefit from more memory than the default 2 GB minimum. Create multiple jobs.When creating a job with multiple server sources, each server is contacted in serial fashion for inventory, transfer, and cutover. This means that each server must complete its phase before another server starts. To run more servers in parallel, simply create multiple jobs, with each job containing only one server. SMS supports up to 100 simultaneously running jobs, meaning a single orchestrator can parallelize many destination computers. We don't recommend running multiple parallel jobs if your destination computers are Windows Server 2016 or Windows Server 2012 R2 as without the SMS proxy service running on the destination, the orchestrator must perform all transfers itself and could become a bottleneck. The ability for servers to run in parallel inside a single job is a feature we plan to add in a later version of SMS. Use SMB 3 with RDMA networks.If transferring from a Windows Server 2012 or later source computer, SMB 3.x supports SMB Direct mode and RDMA networking. RDMA moves most CPU cost of transfer from the motherboard CPUs to onboard NIC processors, reducing latency and server CPU utilization. In addition, RDMA networks like ROCE and iWARP typically have substantially higher bandwidth than typical TCP/ethernet, including 25, 50, and 100 Gb speeds per interface. Using SMB Direct typically moves the transfer speed limit from the network down to the storage itself. Use SMB 3 multichannel.If transferring from a Windows Server 2012 or later source computer, SMB 3.x supports multichannel copies that can greatly improve file copy performance. This feature works automatically as long as the source and destination both have: Update drivers.As appropriate, install latest vendor storage and enclosure firmware and drivers, latest vendor HBA drivers, latest vendor BIOS/UEFI firmware, latest vendor network drivers, and latest motherboard chipset drivers on source, destination, and orchestrator servers. Restart nodes as needed. Consult your hardware vendor documentation for configuring shared storage and networking hardware. Enable high-performance processing.Ensure that BIOS/UEFI settings for servers enable high performance, such as disabling C-State, setting QPI speed, enabling NUMA, and setting highest memory frequency. Ensure power management in Windows Server is set to High Performance. Restart as required. Don't forget to return these to appropriate states after completing migration. Tune hardware.Review thePerformance Tuning Guidelines for Windows Server 2022for tuning the orchestrator and destination computers running Windows Server. TheNetwork Subsystem Performance Tuningsection contains especially valuable information. There are also guides for older operating systems. Use faster storage.While it may be difficult to upgrade the source computer storage speed, you should ensure the destination storage is at least as fast at write IO performance as the source is at read IO performance in order to ensure there's no unnecessary  bottleneck in transfers. If the destination is a VM, ensure that, at least for the purposes of migration, it runs in the fastest storage layer of your hypervisor hosts, such as on the flash tier or with Storage Spaces Direct HCI clusters utilizing mirrored all-flash or hybrid spaces. When the SMS migration is complete the VM can be live migrated to a slower tier or host. Use SMB compression.If your source and destination servers are Windows Server 2022, you can enable SMB compression to gain significant performance gains on larger files. Review (SMB compression)[/windows-server/storage/file-server/smb-compression]. Update antivirus.Always ensure your source and destination are running the latest patched version of antivirus software to ensure minimal performance overhead. As a test,temporarilyexclude scanning of folders you're inventorying or migrating on the source and destination servers. If your transfer performance is improved, contact your antivirus software vendor for instructions or for an updated version of the antivirus software or an explanation of expected performance degradation. The Storage Migration Service doesn't support migrating from the NTFS to ReFS file systems. You can migrate from NTFS to NTFS, and ReFS to ReFS. This is by design, due to the many differences in functionality, metadata, and other aspects that ReFS doesn't duplicate from NTFS. ReFS is intended as an application workload file system, not a general file system. For more information, seeResilient File System (ReFS) overview The Storage Migration Service uses an extensible storage engine (ESE) database that is installed by default in the hidden c:\programdata\microsoft\storagemigrationservice folder. This database will grow as jobs are added and transfers are completed, and can consume significant drive space after migrating millions of files if you don't delete jobs. If the database needs to move, perform the following steps: Stop the ""Storage Migration Service"" service on the orchestrator computer. Take ownership of the%programdata%/Microsoft/StorageMigrationServicefolder Add your user account to have full control over that share and all of its files and subfolders. Move the folder to another drive on the orchestrator computer. Set the following registry REG_SZ value: HKEY_Local_Machine\Software\Microsoft\SMS
DatabasePath =path to the new database folder on a different volume Ensure that the ""SYSTEM"" and ""Network Service"" accounts have full control to all files and subfolders of that folder Remove your own accounts permissions. Start the ""Storage Migration Service"" service. No, the Storage Migration Service doesn't migrate locally installed applications. After your complete migration, reinstall any applications onto the destination computer that were running on the source computer. There's no need to reconfigure any users or their applications; the Storage Migration Service is designed to make the server change invisible to clients. When performing a transfer, the Storage Migration Service seeks to mirror data from the source server. The destination server shouldn't contain any production data or connected users, as that data could be overwritten. By default, the first transfer makes a backup copy of any data on the destination server as a safeguard. On all subsequent transfers, by default, the Storage Migration Service mirrors data onto the destination; this means not only adding new files, but also arbitrarily overwriting any existing files and deleting any files not present on the source. This behavior is intentional and provides perfect fidelity with the source computer. Most errors found in the transfer CSV file are Windows System Error Codes. You can find out what each error means by reviewing theWin32 error codes documentation. A destination server may contain certificates - issued prior to cutover - in its local certificate store, with the name of the server being part of the subject, subject alternative name, or other fields. When cutover occurs and the server is renamed, these certificates aren't updated. You must reissue certificates to your newly renamed servers using your current deployment methods, such as Group Policy or web enrollment.

There is a separateFAQ wikithat Partner can share with their Customers post-production. - Integration Phase - Data Privacy - Customer Setup - Product Functionality: One-Click Export - Product Functionality: Misc - Certification Please referenceRSC developer documentation Reach out to LinkedIn Business Development to fill out the Onboarding Request Form and follow steps in theRSC developer documentation. New Talent Solutions integrations like Recruiter System Connect are built on the Middleware Platform, which means you should manage job applications via the /atsApplications and  /atsCandidates endpoint instead of /simpleJobApplications. If youâ€™ve previously integrated with LinkedIn Referrals, youâ€™ll need to switch to using the Middleware Platform for submitting job applications. No. The minimum product and technical requirements for RSC are indicated in this document and partners may not elect to enable a subset. We require all historical candidate, applications, and jobs records to ensure LinkedIn Recruiter is as valuable as possible for your customers [i.e. the â€œRediscovered Candidatesâ€ Spotlight, â€˜In-ATS Indicatorâ€™] Many customers will not need to do so if their privacy policies allows them to share candidate data to their third party partners. However, customers will need to consult their own legal teams regarding this prior to activating RSC. Some partners include a disclaimer in the onboarding widget that requires the customer to authorize the sharing of ATS data with LinkedIn. Customers will be able to turn on all their middleware integrations via a widget in the ATS and in their Recruiter dashboard. Seetechnical docs Customers must email the Partner and LinkedIn support notifying us they would like to deactivate RSC. Customer can contact LinkedIn support at ltsatsintegrations@linkedin.com Rcorp (Recruiter Corporate), RPS (Recruiter Professional Services), and Recruiter SMB The ATS partner can confirm the duplication was handled in the ATS when LI passes back the PersonURN (Member ID) to the ATS Partner LinkedIn members that don't have their privacy settings set to share their profile with third parties will not have One-Click Export functionality enabled. Customer can create a standard ""dummy req"" field in the drop down that Recruiter will be able to export the candidate to if they do not want to associate the candidate with a Job Req. ATS can then conduct any matching required on their end. However, customers will need to consult their legal team to determine if they can export data unassociated with a requisition. Yes it will show all open jobs that the user has permissions to see based on Security Groups. If a Partner has not enabled Security Groups, all open jobs will be seen by all users. Customers can search for jobs based on type head Call volume for One-Click Export is 300 calls per Recruiter seat per month. LinkedIn reserves the right to change rate limits including to prevent abuse and protect privacy and security. ATS will validate this push event against the signature in the request, outlined in ourdocumentation. This is an expected behavior, whencompanyJobCodeexist, it takes precedence overexternalJobPostingId LI will post jobs based on the language that the customer posts in. If the job requires multiple languages, the customer should have separate listings for each language. The preferred integration is to send in real-time Jobs will default to 180 days if there is no expiration date passed in. For jobs with multiple locations, the current solution is to post one requisition per location. Or, send only the primary location if that designation exists.
For jobs with no location (e.g. virtual jobs), you may either: Not send these jobs, or Default to a specific location (for example, headquarter). Jobs will not be posted without a location No, the way the middleware platform is architected, it needs to be through the Simple Job Posting API. Yes, LinkedIn integrations are set up at the contract level, so customers can have separate integrations for any of their contracts. Recruiter users can switch between contracts, and each contract can be associated with one or more integrations.
Partners must be able to support multiple contracts for the same customer. There is an â€œSend InMailâ€ button in the profile widget that allows sending InMails. It sends a notification to the ATS user in LinkedIn Recruiter when there are profile updates for the relevant candidate. If a candidate deletes their LinkedIn account, they can reactivate it within 21 days. After 21 days, we purge the deleted accounts and populate that information within theClosed Candidates Endpoint. Our ATS partners must query this endpoint periodically (at least once in 30 days) and purge the accounts (that appear within this endpoint) from their records. When an API Job is designated asBasic, either by creating a new Basic API Job or by inline downgrading aPremiumAPI Job, it will be visible in the RSC 1CE (one click export).
Inline upgrading aBasicAPI Job to aPremiumJob does not change its visibility in the RSC 1CE; the job remains visible until it is closed.
Similarly, inline downgrading aPremiumAPI Job to aBasicJob will make the job appear in the RSC 1CE. No updates to an API Job, except for theCLOSEaction, are sent to the RSC.
We will implement a change, once ready, where public and private jobs will be synchronized separately. Until your integration aligns with this update, the above recommendation applies to your ATS. Yes, it's an all-or-nothing integration (with the exception of the feature that enables the sending of Interview Notes and Feedback to LinkedIn Recruiter, which is optional) ; however partners can test and certify each module along the way prior to launch. The requirements are laid out in thedeveloperandrequired fieldsdocumentation. First name and last name are used as part of our matching algorithm, though the fields are optional. The preference would be to split firstName and lastName if you have it The throttling is based on the number of API calls being made. We don't have any maximum limits of how much data can be synced by customers. The Sync API will consider any data after the initial push as an update.  As long as you are sending the correct fields and values against it, there should be no problem. This varies across our ATS partners, however we generally see this reflected within a few minutes. Ideally this should be as real-time as possible. Yes, the button should show up if there was a network error. Once the request is sent, the button changes to Notify Partner, after this you should be able to call /atsIntegrationsAPI. People are matched on the basis of email first and then phone number, subject to the relevant memberâ€™s privacy settings. If the matching made is incorrect or cannot be found, LinkedIn allows the Customer to manually match in the Profile Widget. Refer to thisAPI. This updates the 'manualMatchedMember' attribute for synced candidates. It is advised that if the value for the manualMatchedMember field is present then ATS should always use that instead of the values present in the 'matchedMembers' attribute. The jobs are sent in a sequence and also returned back in a sequence. So you would be keeping track of the sequence and able to match it accordingly. No. The minimum character length is to ensure this is a genuine job and not spam. We accept only quality jobs so that is why we have the restriction. If the description is within 10K characters, this should be fine. Within the widget there is a callback function parameter which on link / unlink allows your system to add or update the appropriate person URN to update and store. The person URN connects the candidate to the job post and all other information related to the candidate including notes, job application status, etc. Usein.parse()to reload the widget on a single page application. The Linkedin LTS Partner Operations (PO) team proactively renews contracts. This is a monthly activity and we renew your contract once its near expiry. This gives a seamless LinkedIn RSC experience without the need to raise a ticket for contract renewal. It is recommended to test the InMail functionality for RSC Integrations by sending InMails to your first degree connections. One can send unlimited inMails because there is no restriction to it. To be able to test this feature, the users should be connected to the developers of our team. Through ACL, we control the visibility of any jobs to only user(s). ACLs consist of two parts -atsEntityAclsfor groups andatsEntityAclAssigneesfor members who can view the jobs.

Can guest users reset their multifactor authentication method?,Yes. Guest users can reset their multifactor authentication method the same way that regular users do.,"This article addresses frequently asked questions about passkey support in Authenticator. Keep checking back for updated content. To complete cross-device authentication by using passkeys in Authenticator, you must enable Bluetooth on both the laptop and the mobile device. Both devices need internet access. You can have only one passkey for each account in Authenticator. At this time, Authenticator only supports passkeys for Microsoft Entra ID. You can use the Authenticator camera to register and authenticate with passkeys. This option is useful if your organization doesn't push the system camera app to Android Work Profile. You can't use passkeys without an internet connection.
For same-device scenarios, the mobile device that contains the passkey needs internet access.
For cross-device scenarios, both the device with the passkey and the secondary device where you want to sign in need internet access. Make sure that Bluetooth and an active internet connection are enabled on both devices.
Also, allow connectivity to these two endpoints in your organization to enable cross-device registration and authentication: The Authenticator app usesAndroid APIson Android 14 or higher to use passkeys.
Manufacturers choose whether or not to implement these APIs for each device they make.
If your device doesn't support these APIs, the Authenticator app might not work for your device on Android 14.
For the best experience, we recommend that you upgrade to Android 15. No. Only limited authentication methods are available for Authenticator in China.

Which organization is responsible for multifactor authentication licenses?,The inviting organization performs multifactor authentication. The inviting organization must make sure that the organization has enough licenses for their B2B users who are using multifactor authentication.,"Windows Hello for Business replaces password sign-in with strong authentication, using an asymmetric key pair. This Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) article is intended to help you learn more about Windows Hello for Business. Windows Hellois an authentication technology that allows users to sign in to their Windows devices using biometric data, or a PIN, instead of a traditional password. Windows Hello for Businessis an extension of Windows Hello that provides enterprise-grade security and management capabilities, including device attestation, certificate-based authentication, and conditional access policies. Policy settings can be deployed to devices to ensure they're secure and compliant with organizational requirements. Three main reasons: The statementA PIN is stronger than a passwordis not directed at the strength of the entropy used by the PIN. It's about the difference between providing entropy versus continuing the use of a symmetric key (the password). The TPM has anti-hammering features that thwart brute-force PIN attacks (an attacker's continuous attempt to try all combination of PINs). Some organizations may worry about shoulder surfing. For those organizations, rather than increase the complexity of the PIN, implement theMultifactor Unlockfeature. To compromise a Windows Hello credential that TPM protects, an attacker must have access to the physical device. Then, the attacker must find a way to spoof the user's biometrics or guess the PIN. All these actions must be done beforeTPM anti-hammeringprotection locks the device. Windows Hello enables biometric sign-in with fingerprint, iris, or facial recognition. When you set up Windows Hello, you're asked to create a PIN after the biometric setup. The PIN enables you to sign in when you can't use your preferred biometric because of an injury or because the sensor is unavailable or not working properly.
If you only had a biometric sign-in configured and, for any reason, were unable to use that method to sign in, you would have to sign in using your account and password, which doesn't provide you with the same level of protection as Hello. Anytime key material is generated, it must be protected against attack. The most robust way to do this is through specialized hardware. There's a long history of using hardware security modules (HSMs) to generate, store, and process keys for security-critical applications. Smart cards are a special type of HSM, as are devices that are compliant with the Trusted Computing Group TPM standard. Wherever possible, the Windows Hello for Business implementation takes advantage of onboard TPM hardware to generate and protect keys. Administrators can choose to allow key operations in software, but it's recommended the use of TPM hardware. The TPM protects against a variety of known and potential attacks, including PIN brute-force attacks. The TPM provides an additional layer of protection after an account lockout, too. When the TPM has locked the key material, the user will have to reset the PIN (which means the user will have to use MFA to reauthenticate to the IdP before the IdP allows re-registration). Resetting the PIN means that all keys and certificates encrypted with the old key material will be removed. Windows Hello for Business provides a PIN caching user experience by using a ticketing system. Rather than caching a PIN, processes cache a ticket they can use to request private key operations. Microsoft Entra ID and Active Directory sign-in keys are cached under lock. This means the keys remain available for use without prompting, as long as the user is interactively signed-in. Microsoft Account sign-in keys are transactional keys, which means the user is always prompted when accessing the key. Windows Hello for Business used as a smart card (smart card emulation that is enabled by default) provides the same user experience of default smart card PIN caching. Each process requesting a private key operation prompts the user for the PIN on first use. Subsequent private key operations won't prompt the user for the PIN. The smart card emulation feature of Windows Hello for Business verifies the PIN and then discards the PIN in exchange for a ticket. The process doesn't receive the PIN, but rather the ticket that grants them private key operations. There isn't a policy setting to adjust the caching. When you enroll in Windows Hello, a representation of your biometrics, called an enrollment profile, is created. The enrollment profile biometrics data is device specific, is stored locally on the device, and does not leave the device or roam with the user. Some external fingerprint sensors store biometric data on the fingerprint module itself rather than on Windows device. Even in this case, the biometrics data is stored locally on those modules, is device specific, doesn't roam, never leaves the module, and is never sent to Microsoft cloud or external server. For more details, seeWindows Hello biometrics in the enterpriseandWindows Hello face authentication. Windows Hello biometrics data is stored on the device as an encrypted template database. The data from the biometrics sensor (like face camera or fingerprint reader) creates a data representationâ€”or graphâ€”that is then encrypted before it's stored on the device. Each biometrics sensor on the device which is used by Windows Hello (face or fingerprint) will have its own biometric database file where template data is stored. Each biometrics database file is encrypted with unique, randomly generated key that is encrypted to the system using AES encryption producing an SHA256 hash. Since Windows Hello biometrics data is stored in encrypted format, no user, or any process other than Windows Hello has access to it. Windows Hello biometrics template database file is created on the device only when a user is enrolled into Windows Hello biometrics-based authentication. An IT administrator may configure policy settings, but it's always a user's choice if they want to use biometrics or PIN. Users can check their current enrollment into Windows Hello biometrics by going to sign-in options on their device. Go toStart > Settings > Accounts > Sign-inoptions. If you don't see Windows Hello in Sign-in options, then it may not be available for your device or blocked by admin via policy. Admins can request users to enroll into Windows Hello during Autopilot or during the initial setup of the device. Admins can disallow users to enroll into biometrics via Windows Hello for Business policy configurations. However, when allowed via policy configurations, enrollment into Windows Hello biometrics is always optional for users. To remove Windows Hello and any associated biometric identification data from the device, openStart > Settings > Accounts > Sign-in options. Select the Windows Hello biometrics authentication method you want to remove, and then selectRemove. The action unenrolls from Windows Hello biometrics authentication and deletes the associated biometrics template database file. For more details, seeWindows sign-in options and account protection (microsoft.com). Starting in Configuration Manager, version 2203, Windows Hello for Business deployments using Configuration Manager are no longer supported. You can delete the Windows Hello for Business container by executing the commandcertutil.exe -deleteHelloContainer. If the user can sign in with a password, they can reset their PIN by selecting theI forgot my PINlink in the Settings app or from the lock screen, by selecting theI forgot my PINlink on the PIN credential provider. For on-premises deployments, devices must be connected to their on-premises network (domain controllers and/or certificate authority) to reset their PINs. Hybrid deployments can onboard their Microsoft Entra tenant to use theWindows Hello for Business PIN reset serviceto reset their PINs. Non-destructive PIN reset works without access to the corporate network. Destructive PIN reset requires access to the corporate network. For more details about destructive and non-destructive PIN reset, seePIN reset. Yes. Our simple PIN algorithm looks for and disallows any PIN that has a constant delta from one digit to the next. The algorithm counts the number of steps required to reach the next digit, overflowing at 10 ('zero').
So, for example: This check prevents repeating numbers, sequential numbers, and simple patterns. It always results in a list of 100 disallowed PINs (independent of the PIN length). This algorithm doesn't apply to alphanumeric PINs. To help Microsoft keep things working properly, to help detecting and preventing fraud, and to continue improving Windows Hello, diagnostic data about how people use Windows Hello is collected. For example: No. The movement away from passwords is accomplished by gradually reducing the use of the password. In situations where you can't authenticate by using biometrics, you need a fallback mechanism that isn't a password. The PIN is the fallback mechanism. Disabling or hiding the PIN credential provider will disable the use of biometrics. The unauthorized user won't be able to utilize any biometric options and will have the only option to enter a PIN. If the user attempts to unlock the device by entering random PINs, after three unsuccessful attempts the credential provider will display the following message:You've entered an incorrect PIN several times. To try again, enter A1B2C3 below.
Upon entering the challenge phraseA1B2C3, the user will be granted one more opportunity to enter the PIN. If unsuccessful, the provider will be disabled, leaving the user with the only option to reboot the device. Following the reboot, the aforementioned pattern repeats. If unsuccessful attempts continue, the device will enter a lockout state, lasting for 1 minute after the first reboot, 2 minutes after the fourth reboot, and 10 minutes after the fifth reboot. The duration of each lockout increases accordingly. This behavior is a result of the TPM 2.0 anti-hammering feature.
For more information about the TPM anti-hammering feature, seeTPM 2.0 anti-hammering. Yes. You can use the on-premises Windows Hello for Business deployment and combine it with a non-Microsoft MFA provider that doesn't require internet connectivity to achieve an air-gapped Windows Hello for Business deployment. The maximum number of supported enrollments on a single device is 10. This lets 10 users each enroll their face and up to 10 fingerprints. For devices with more than 10 users, or for users that sign-in to many devices (for example, a support technician), it's recommended the use of FIDO2 security keys. No. If your organization is using Microsoft cloud services, then you must use a hybrid deployment model. On-premises deployments are exclusive to organizations who need more time before moving to the cloud and exclusively use Active Directory. ReviewMicrosoft Entra Connect Sync: Attributes synchronized to Microsoft Entra IDfor a list of attributes that sync based on scenarios. The base scenarios that include Windows Hello for Business are theWindows 10scenario and theDevice writebackscenario. Your environment may include other attributes. Yes, if you're using federated hybrid deployment, you can use any non-Microsoft that provides an AD FS MFA adapter. A list of non-Microsoft MFA adapters can be foundhere. Windows Hello for Business works with any non-Microsoft federation servers that support the protocols used during the provisioning experience. Windows Hello for Business is not designed to work with local accounts. ReadWindows Hello biometric requirementsfor more information. Wearing a mask to enroll is a security concern because other users wearing a similar mask may be able to unlock your device. Remove a mask if you're wearing one when you enroll or unlock with Windows Hello face authentication. If your working environment doesn't allow you to remove a mask temporarily, consider un-enrolling from face authentication and only using PIN or fingerprint. A user will be prompted to set up a Windows Hello for Business key on a Microsoft Entra registered devices if the feature is enabled by policy. If the user has an existing Windows Hello container, the Windows Hello for Business key will be enrolled in that container and will be protected using existing gestures. If a user has signed into their Microsoft Entra registered device with Windows Hello, their Windows Hello for Business key will be used to authenticate the user's work identity when they try to use Microsoft Entra resources. The Windows Hello for Business key meets Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication (MFA) requirements and reduces the number of MFA prompts users will see when accessing resources. It's possible to Microsoft Entra register a domain joined device. If the domain joined device has a convenience PIN, sign in with the convenience PIN will no longer work. This configuration isn't supported by Windows Hello for Business. For more information, seeMicrosoft Entra registered devices. Windows Hello for Business is a feature of the Windows platform. No, Microsoft Entra Domain Services is a separately managed environment in Azure, and hybrid device registration with cloud Microsoft Entra ID isn't available for it via Microsoft Entra Connect. Hence, Windows Hello for Business doesn't work with Microsoft Entra Domain Services. Windows Hello for Business is two-factor authentication based on the observed authentication factors of:something you have,something you know, andsomething that's part of you. Windows Hello for Business incorporates two of these factors: something you have (the user's private key protected by the device's security module) and something you know (your PIN). With the proper hardware, you can enhance the user experience by introducing biometrics. By using biometrics, you can replace the ""something you know"" authentication factor with the ""something that is part of you"" factor, with the assurances that users can fall back to the ""something you know factor"". Note The Windows Hello for Business key meets Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication (MFA) requirements and reduces the number of MFA prompts users will see when accessing resources. For more information, seeWhat is a Primary Refresh Token. Both types of authentication provide the same security; one is not more secure than the other.
The trust models of your deployment determine how you authenticate to Active Directory. Both key trust and certificate trust use the same hardware-backed, two-factor credential. The difference between the two trust types is the issuance of end-entity certificates: Convenience PINprovides a simpler way to sign in to Windows than passwords, but it still uses a password for authentication. When the correct convenience PIN is provided to Windows, the password information is loaded from its cache and authenticates the user. Organizations using convenience PINs should move toWindows Hello for Business. New Windows deployments should deploy Windows Hello for Business and not convenience PINs. No. While it's possible to set a convenience PIN on Microsoft Entra joined and Microsoft Entra hybrid joined devices, convenience PIN isn't supported for Microsoft Entra user accounts (including synchronized identities). Convenience PIN is only supported for on-premises Active Directory users and local account users. Windows Hello for Business is the modern, two-factor authentication for Windows. Customers using virtual smart cards are strongly encouraged to move to Windows Hello for Business. For a list of required URLs, seeMicrosoft 365 Common and Office Online. If your environment uses Microsoft Intune, seeNetwork endpoints for Microsoft Intune. Yes, you can use an external Windows Hello compatible camera if a device has an internal Windows Hello camera. When both cameras are present, the external camera is used for face authentication. For more information, seeIT tools to support Windows 10, version 21H1. If ESS is enabled, seeWindows Hello Enhanced Sign-in Security. Some laptops and tablets with keyboards that close may not use an external Windows Hello compatible camera or other Windows Hello compatible accessory when the computer is docked with the lid closed. The issue has been addressed in Windows 11, version 22H2. Windows Hello for Business credentials need access to device state, which is not available in private browser mode or incognito mode. Hence it can't be used in private browser or Incognito mode. You can usemultifactor unlockto require users to provide an extra factor to unlock their device. Authentication remains two-factor, but another factor is required before Windows allows the user to reach the desktop. To learn more, seeMultifactor Unlock. Windows Hello for Businesscloud Kerberos trustis atrust modelthat enables Windows Hello for Business deployment using the infrastructure introduced for supportingsecurity key sign-in on Microsoft Entra hybrid joined devices and on-premises resource access on Microsoft Entra joined devices. Cloud Kerberos trust is the preferred deployment model if you do not need to support certificate authentication scenarios. For more information, seecloud Kerberos trust deployment. This feature doesn't work in a pure on-premises AD domain services environment. Windows Hello for Business cloud Kerberos trust functions correctly when the client authenticates directly to a writable domain controller or to a Read-Only Domain Controller (RODC) that doesn't cache the user's credentials, in accordance with the Password Replication Policy. If the client attempts to authenticate to an RODC that can cache the user's credentials, cloud Kerberos trust authentication might fail. To mitigate this, deploy KDC certificates to all RODCs to support Windows Hello for Business key trust authentication, which is also required for those RODCs to support LDAP over SSL. This configuration ensures that authentication can seamlessly failover to Windows Hello for Business key trust authentication, thereby guaranteeing successful user authentication. Windows Hello for Business cloud Kerberos trust requires line of sight to a domain controller when: Windows Hello for Business cloud Kerberos trust can't be used as a supplied credential with RDP/VDI. Similar to key trust, cloud Kerberos trust can be used for RDP if acertificate is enrolled into Windows Hello for Businessfor this purpose. As an alternative, consider usingRemote Credential Guardwhich doesn't require to deploy certificates. No, only the number necessary to handle the load from all cloud Kerberos trust devices. In a hybrid deployment, a user's public key must sync from Microsoft Entra ID to Active Directory before it can be used to authenticate against a domain controller. This sync is handled by Microsoft Entra Connect and will occur during a normal sync cycle. Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) doesn't support using key-based authentication as supplied credentials. However, you can deploy certificates in the key trust model to enable RDP. For more information, seeDeploying certificates to key trust users to enable RDP. As an alternative, consider usingRemote Credential Guardwhich doesn't require to deploy certificates.

What if a partner organization already has multifactor authentication set up? Can we trust their multifactor authentication?,Cross-tenant access settings  let you trust multifactor authentication and device claims ( compliant claims and Microsoft Entra hybrid joined claims ) from other Microsoft Entra organizations.,"Windows Hello for Business replaces password sign-in with strong authentication, using an asymmetric key pair. This Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) article is intended to help you learn more about Windows Hello for Business. Windows Hellois an authentication technology that allows users to sign in to their Windows devices using biometric data, or a PIN, instead of a traditional password. Windows Hello for Businessis an extension of Windows Hello that provides enterprise-grade security and management capabilities, including device attestation, certificate-based authentication, and conditional access policies. Policy settings can be deployed to devices to ensure they're secure and compliant with organizational requirements. Three main reasons: The statementA PIN is stronger than a passwordis not directed at the strength of the entropy used by the PIN. It's about the difference between providing entropy versus continuing the use of a symmetric key (the password). The TPM has anti-hammering features that thwart brute-force PIN attacks (an attacker's continuous attempt to try all combination of PINs). Some organizations may worry about shoulder surfing. For those organizations, rather than increase the complexity of the PIN, implement theMultifactor Unlockfeature. To compromise a Windows Hello credential that TPM protects, an attacker must have access to the physical device. Then, the attacker must find a way to spoof the user's biometrics or guess the PIN. All these actions must be done beforeTPM anti-hammeringprotection locks the device. Windows Hello enables biometric sign-in with fingerprint, iris, or facial recognition. When you set up Windows Hello, you're asked to create a PIN after the biometric setup. The PIN enables you to sign in when you can't use your preferred biometric because of an injury or because the sensor is unavailable or not working properly.
If you only had a biometric sign-in configured and, for any reason, were unable to use that method to sign in, you would have to sign in using your account and password, which doesn't provide you with the same level of protection as Hello. Anytime key material is generated, it must be protected against attack. The most robust way to do this is through specialized hardware. There's a long history of using hardware security modules (HSMs) to generate, store, and process keys for security-critical applications. Smart cards are a special type of HSM, as are devices that are compliant with the Trusted Computing Group TPM standard. Wherever possible, the Windows Hello for Business implementation takes advantage of onboard TPM hardware to generate and protect keys. Administrators can choose to allow key operations in software, but it's recommended the use of TPM hardware. The TPM protects against a variety of known and potential attacks, including PIN brute-force attacks. The TPM provides an additional layer of protection after an account lockout, too. When the TPM has locked the key material, the user will have to reset the PIN (which means the user will have to use MFA to reauthenticate to the IdP before the IdP allows re-registration). Resetting the PIN means that all keys and certificates encrypted with the old key material will be removed. Windows Hello for Business provides a PIN caching user experience by using a ticketing system. Rather than caching a PIN, processes cache a ticket they can use to request private key operations. Microsoft Entra ID and Active Directory sign-in keys are cached under lock. This means the keys remain available for use without prompting, as long as the user is interactively signed-in. Microsoft Account sign-in keys are transactional keys, which means the user is always prompted when accessing the key. Windows Hello for Business used as a smart card (smart card emulation that is enabled by default) provides the same user experience of default smart card PIN caching. Each process requesting a private key operation prompts the user for the PIN on first use. Subsequent private key operations won't prompt the user for the PIN. The smart card emulation feature of Windows Hello for Business verifies the PIN and then discards the PIN in exchange for a ticket. The process doesn't receive the PIN, but rather the ticket that grants them private key operations. There isn't a policy setting to adjust the caching. When you enroll in Windows Hello, a representation of your biometrics, called an enrollment profile, is created. The enrollment profile biometrics data is device specific, is stored locally on the device, and does not leave the device or roam with the user. Some external fingerprint sensors store biometric data on the fingerprint module itself rather than on Windows device. Even in this case, the biometrics data is stored locally on those modules, is device specific, doesn't roam, never leaves the module, and is never sent to Microsoft cloud or external server. For more details, seeWindows Hello biometrics in the enterpriseandWindows Hello face authentication. Windows Hello biometrics data is stored on the device as an encrypted template database. The data from the biometrics sensor (like face camera or fingerprint reader) creates a data representationâ€”or graphâ€”that is then encrypted before it's stored on the device. Each biometrics sensor on the device which is used by Windows Hello (face or fingerprint) will have its own biometric database file where template data is stored. Each biometrics database file is encrypted with unique, randomly generated key that is encrypted to the system using AES encryption producing an SHA256 hash. Since Windows Hello biometrics data is stored in encrypted format, no user, or any process other than Windows Hello has access to it. Windows Hello biometrics template database file is created on the device only when a user is enrolled into Windows Hello biometrics-based authentication. An IT administrator may configure policy settings, but it's always a user's choice if they want to use biometrics or PIN. Users can check their current enrollment into Windows Hello biometrics by going to sign-in options on their device. Go toStart > Settings > Accounts > Sign-inoptions. If you don't see Windows Hello in Sign-in options, then it may not be available for your device or blocked by admin via policy. Admins can request users to enroll into Windows Hello during Autopilot or during the initial setup of the device. Admins can disallow users to enroll into biometrics via Windows Hello for Business policy configurations. However, when allowed via policy configurations, enrollment into Windows Hello biometrics is always optional for users. To remove Windows Hello and any associated biometric identification data from the device, openStart > Settings > Accounts > Sign-in options. Select the Windows Hello biometrics authentication method you want to remove, and then selectRemove. The action unenrolls from Windows Hello biometrics authentication and deletes the associated biometrics template database file. For more details, seeWindows sign-in options and account protection (microsoft.com). Starting in Configuration Manager, version 2203, Windows Hello for Business deployments using Configuration Manager are no longer supported. You can delete the Windows Hello for Business container by executing the commandcertutil.exe -deleteHelloContainer. If the user can sign in with a password, they can reset their PIN by selecting theI forgot my PINlink in the Settings app or from the lock screen, by selecting theI forgot my PINlink on the PIN credential provider. For on-premises deployments, devices must be connected to their on-premises network (domain controllers and/or certificate authority) to reset their PINs. Hybrid deployments can onboard their Microsoft Entra tenant to use theWindows Hello for Business PIN reset serviceto reset their PINs. Non-destructive PIN reset works without access to the corporate network. Destructive PIN reset requires access to the corporate network. For more details about destructive and non-destructive PIN reset, seePIN reset. Yes. Our simple PIN algorithm looks for and disallows any PIN that has a constant delta from one digit to the next. The algorithm counts the number of steps required to reach the next digit, overflowing at 10 ('zero').
So, for example: This check prevents repeating numbers, sequential numbers, and simple patterns. It always results in a list of 100 disallowed PINs (independent of the PIN length). This algorithm doesn't apply to alphanumeric PINs. To help Microsoft keep things working properly, to help detecting and preventing fraud, and to continue improving Windows Hello, diagnostic data about how people use Windows Hello is collected. For example: No. The movement away from passwords is accomplished by gradually reducing the use of the password. In situations where you can't authenticate by using biometrics, you need a fallback mechanism that isn't a password. The PIN is the fallback mechanism. Disabling or hiding the PIN credential provider will disable the use of biometrics. The unauthorized user won't be able to utilize any biometric options and will have the only option to enter a PIN. If the user attempts to unlock the device by entering random PINs, after three unsuccessful attempts the credential provider will display the following message:You've entered an incorrect PIN several times. To try again, enter A1B2C3 below.
Upon entering the challenge phraseA1B2C3, the user will be granted one more opportunity to enter the PIN. If unsuccessful, the provider will be disabled, leaving the user with the only option to reboot the device. Following the reboot, the aforementioned pattern repeats. If unsuccessful attempts continue, the device will enter a lockout state, lasting for 1 minute after the first reboot, 2 minutes after the fourth reboot, and 10 minutes after the fifth reboot. The duration of each lockout increases accordingly. This behavior is a result of the TPM 2.0 anti-hammering feature.
For more information about the TPM anti-hammering feature, seeTPM 2.0 anti-hammering. Yes. You can use the on-premises Windows Hello for Business deployment and combine it with a non-Microsoft MFA provider that doesn't require internet connectivity to achieve an air-gapped Windows Hello for Business deployment. The maximum number of supported enrollments on a single device is 10. This lets 10 users each enroll their face and up to 10 fingerprints. For devices with more than 10 users, or for users that sign-in to many devices (for example, a support technician), it's recommended the use of FIDO2 security keys. No. If your organization is using Microsoft cloud services, then you must use a hybrid deployment model. On-premises deployments are exclusive to organizations who need more time before moving to the cloud and exclusively use Active Directory. ReviewMicrosoft Entra Connect Sync: Attributes synchronized to Microsoft Entra IDfor a list of attributes that sync based on scenarios. The base scenarios that include Windows Hello for Business are theWindows 10scenario and theDevice writebackscenario. Your environment may include other attributes. Yes, if you're using federated hybrid deployment, you can use any non-Microsoft that provides an AD FS MFA adapter. A list of non-Microsoft MFA adapters can be foundhere. Windows Hello for Business works with any non-Microsoft federation servers that support the protocols used during the provisioning experience. Windows Hello for Business is not designed to work with local accounts. ReadWindows Hello biometric requirementsfor more information. Wearing a mask to enroll is a security concern because other users wearing a similar mask may be able to unlock your device. Remove a mask if you're wearing one when you enroll or unlock with Windows Hello face authentication. If your working environment doesn't allow you to remove a mask temporarily, consider un-enrolling from face authentication and only using PIN or fingerprint. A user will be prompted to set up a Windows Hello for Business key on a Microsoft Entra registered devices if the feature is enabled by policy. If the user has an existing Windows Hello container, the Windows Hello for Business key will be enrolled in that container and will be protected using existing gestures. If a user has signed into their Microsoft Entra registered device with Windows Hello, their Windows Hello for Business key will be used to authenticate the user's work identity when they try to use Microsoft Entra resources. The Windows Hello for Business key meets Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication (MFA) requirements and reduces the number of MFA prompts users will see when accessing resources. It's possible to Microsoft Entra register a domain joined device. If the domain joined device has a convenience PIN, sign in with the convenience PIN will no longer work. This configuration isn't supported by Windows Hello for Business. For more information, seeMicrosoft Entra registered devices. Windows Hello for Business is a feature of the Windows platform. No, Microsoft Entra Domain Services is a separately managed environment in Azure, and hybrid device registration with cloud Microsoft Entra ID isn't available for it via Microsoft Entra Connect. Hence, Windows Hello for Business doesn't work with Microsoft Entra Domain Services. Windows Hello for Business is two-factor authentication based on the observed authentication factors of:something you have,something you know, andsomething that's part of you. Windows Hello for Business incorporates two of these factors: something you have (the user's private key protected by the device's security module) and something you know (your PIN). With the proper hardware, you can enhance the user experience by introducing biometrics. By using biometrics, you can replace the ""something you know"" authentication factor with the ""something that is part of you"" factor, with the assurances that users can fall back to the ""something you know factor"". Note The Windows Hello for Business key meets Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication (MFA) requirements and reduces the number of MFA prompts users will see when accessing resources. For more information, seeWhat is a Primary Refresh Token. Both types of authentication provide the same security; one is not more secure than the other.
The trust models of your deployment determine how you authenticate to Active Directory. Both key trust and certificate trust use the same hardware-backed, two-factor credential. The difference between the two trust types is the issuance of end-entity certificates: Convenience PINprovides a simpler way to sign in to Windows than passwords, but it still uses a password for authentication. When the correct convenience PIN is provided to Windows, the password information is loaded from its cache and authenticates the user. Organizations using convenience PINs should move toWindows Hello for Business. New Windows deployments should deploy Windows Hello for Business and not convenience PINs. No. While it's possible to set a convenience PIN on Microsoft Entra joined and Microsoft Entra hybrid joined devices, convenience PIN isn't supported for Microsoft Entra user accounts (including synchronized identities). Convenience PIN is only supported for on-premises Active Directory users and local account users. Windows Hello for Business is the modern, two-factor authentication for Windows. Customers using virtual smart cards are strongly encouraged to move to Windows Hello for Business. For a list of required URLs, seeMicrosoft 365 Common and Office Online. If your environment uses Microsoft Intune, seeNetwork endpoints for Microsoft Intune. Yes, you can use an external Windows Hello compatible camera if a device has an internal Windows Hello camera.

How many organizations can I add in cross-tenant access settings?,Cross-tenant access settings are a policy in the directory that stores your settings for how you collaborate with other organizations. There are no limits to the number of organizations you can add in cross-tenant access settings.,"For more granular administrative control in Microsoft Entra ID, you can assign users to a Microsoft Entra role with a scope that is limited to one or more administrative units. For sample PowerShell scripts for common tasks, seeWork with administrative units. You must be assigned at least thePrivileged Role Administratorrole to create an administrative unit in Microsoft Entra ID. Check to ensure that the user who's trying to create the administrative unit is assigned thePrivileged Role Administratorrole. When you add a group to an administrative unit, that doesn't result in all the group's members being added to it. Users must be directly assigned to the administrative unit. Sometimes, the addition or removal of one or more members of an administrative unit might take a few minutes to be reflected on theAdministrative unitspane. Alternatively, you can go directly to the associated resource's properties and see whether the action has been completed. For more information about members in administrative units, seeList users, groups, or devices in an administrative unit. As an administrator of an administrative unit, you can reset passwords only for users who are assigned to your administrative unit. Make sure that the user whose password reset is failing belongs to the administrative unit to which you've been assigned. If the user belongs to the same administrative unit but you still can't reset the user's password, check the roles that are assigned to the user. To prevent an elevation of privilege, an administrative unit-scoped administrator can't reset the password of a user who's assigned to a role with an organization-wide scope. Security groups have an existing purpose and authorization model. AUser Administrator, for example, can manage membership of all security groups in the Microsoft Entra organization. The role might use groups to manage access to applications such as Salesforce. AUser Administratorshouldn't be able to manage the delegation model itself, which would be the result if security groups were extended to support ""resource grouping"" scenarios. Administrative units, such as organizational units in Windows Server Active Directory, are intended to provide a way to scope administration of a wide range of directory objects. Security groups themselves can be members of resource scopes. Using security groups to define the set of security groups that an administrator can manage could become confusing. Adding a group to an administrative unit brings the group itself into the management scope of the administrative unit, butnotthe members of the group. For more information, seeAdministrative units in Microsoft Entra ID. Yes, a resource can be a member of more than one administrative unit. The resource can be managed by all organization-wide and administrative unit-scoped administrators who have permissions over the resource. No, administrative units aren't available for B2C organizations. No, nested administrative units aren't supported. Yes. You'll find support for administrative units inPowerShell cmdlet documentationandsample scripts. Find support for theadministrativeUnit resource typein Microsoft Graph. The initial update of an administrative unit can take a few minutes depending on your tenant size and the current Microsoft Entra ID load. This usually means there's a problem with the supplied property values. Confirm that the property values you have supplied have a proper value type (Boolean, string, or string collection). For more information, see the allowed values for each operator forusersordevices. This error can also result if a person without a Microsoft Entra ID P1 license attempts to save an update to the administrative unit. To add a single user, add an appropriate expression with theORquery operator to the rule for dynamic membership groups. When an administrative unit has been configured for dynamic membership groups, you must edit the rules for dynamic membership groups to change membership. The total number of dynamic membership groups and dynamic administrative units combined cannot exceed 15,000. Yes. 3,072 characters. No. As an owner of a protected group, you won't be able to manage it just based on ownership. Managing protected resources currently require a role to be assigned at the restricted management administrative unit scope of the protected resource. Currently, securing Microsoft Entra resources in restricted management administrative units is supported. Resources managed outside of Microsoft Entra ID aren't supported. The user, group, or device is a member of restricted management administrative unit. Management rights are limited to administrators scoped to that administrative unit.

Can I make guest users visible in the Exchange Global Address List?,"Yes. By default, guest objects aren't visible in your organization's global address list, but you can make them visible. For details, see  Add guests to the global address list  in the Microsoft 365 per-group guest access article.","Newly added VL users receive an invitation email from microsoft-noreply@microsoft.com instructing them to complete their registration. The email has the subject ""Action required: Sign in to manage your volume licensing assets"" and is sent to the business email address provided by the VL admin when they add a new user. Every VL contract has at least one designated VL admin responsible for registering the licenses and managing VL roles. This includes viewing, adding, editing, and removing VL user roles, including for other VL admins. By default, the VL admin role is assigned to the Notices Correspondent, or the Primary Contact provided by the License Solutions Partner (LSP), or reseller, when setting up the VL contract. Important If you're the sole VL admin, your absence might hinder your organization's ability to access and manage its VL entitlements. We recommend that you assign at least one alternate admin per license ID. Primary or Notice contacts on the VL contract can choose to forward the invitation to register a license ID to someone else who can then register as the VL admin, instead.  The admin should forward the invitation for each license ID that they donâ€™t want to administer. VL admins who have already registered must assign other VL users as admins. Note There can be more than one VL admin. Assigning another person to be a VL admin for a license ID doesn't remove you from the VL admin role for that license ID. For privacy reasons, we can't provide names of VL admins associated with your organization. Ask your organization's LSP what contact information they provided for your VL contract. If necessary, your organization's purchasing, finance or IT departments might be able to identity your Microsoft Reseller from your organization's purchasing records. Global and Billing Administrators don't have permissions to view or manage VL user roles in the Microsoft 365 admin center unless a VL admin has assigned them a role. VL admin permissions don't include permissions to manage Microsoft services like Microsoft 365, or to add or remove users from the organization's tenant. If a Global or Billing Administrator assigns non-VL admin roles to the VL admin, the VL admin must use the same credentials that they use to sign in to the Volume Licensing Service Center (VLSC). For information about non-VL admin roles in the Microsoft 365 admin center, seeAbout admin roles in the Microsoft 365 admin center. Access to VL information in the Microsoft 365 admin center is removed as soon as a user's work or school account is removed from their organization's domain in Microsoft Entra ID. However, the user is displayed on theManage Assignmentspage until a VL admin removes the user from all license IDs. For more information, see How do I edit or remove permissions of existing VL users? A VL admin can also manually remove VL permissions from a VL user who no longer needs access but who remains in the organization. Primary or Notice Correspondents are formal contacts on the Microsoft VL contract submitted to Microsoft by LSPs. To change these contacts for a license ID, contact your Microsoft Reseller to process the change of contact request on your behalf. Microsoft assigns access at the level of the license ID (the program level at which orders can be placed). Only license IDs for which you're assigned the VL admin role are displayed on admin pages in the Microsoft 365 admin center. VL admins can use the Microsoft 365 admin center to view, edit, or remove VL users for license IDs that they administer. Note There currently isn't a public facing API to manage VL user management tasks. There are seven distinct VL user roles that you can assign for each license ID. Each role permits specific actions to manage VL. The following table shows the relationships between VLSC user roles and Microsoft 365 admin center VL user roles and lists the actions those roles can take. Important Users assigned a VL role in the Volume Licensing Service Center (VLSC) prior to September 15, 2023, and who didn't complete their registration by that date, aren't included in theManage Assignmentslist in the Microsoft 365 admin center. If necessary, VL admins can useAssign users to contractsto add them back. TheManage Assignmentspage contains a list of all the VL users that you invited and includes information like their status and the VL roles that you assigned to them. The following table explains each column in the list. The following table lists the statuses that you might see in theStatuscolumn on theManage Assignmentspage. If you're the Primary Contact, Notices Correspondent, or Online Access Contact named on a Microsoft Business and Services Agreement (MBSA), you can opt in to inherit VL admin permissions on every license ID added under that MBSA. To view your opt-in preferences, use the following steps. ThePreferencesdetails pane displays your name, login email, business email, list of assigned roles, and whether you've chosen to inherit an Administrator role for all future enrollments added under the MBSA. Note The VL admin can't edit or remove permissions on a license ID where permissions are inherited from the higher-level agreement (the MBSA). Add new users who don't already have VL permissions. After a license ID is assigned to a VL user, you can assign VL roles. A user might have different VL roles for different license IDs. To save the updates, selectVerify and save user assignments. When you save updates to VL users, they receive a welcome email inviting them to register their permissions. The email comes from microsoft-noreply@microsoft.com with the subject line ""Action required: Sign in to manage your volume licensing assets."" New users can access and manage the license ID based on the VL roles that you assigned to them approximately two hours after registration is complete. A notification email is also sent to users if their permissions for a license ID change. This email also comes from microsoft-noreply@microsoft.com, with the subject line ""Permission changes for Microsoft Volume Licensing contracts."" When you delete a VL user, the permissions assigned to that user are removed for all the license IDs to which they were assigned, and the user is removed from theManage Assignmentslist. An email is sent to notify the user of the changes. Note Updated permissions can take up to two hours for the role change to be reflected on theManage assignmentspage. For new agreements, it can take up to 10 hours for contract changes to take effect. Microsoft welcomes feedback about existing VL functionality and suggestions for new features. You can use theGive feedbackbutton on the bottom right of any page in the Microsoft 365 admin center to submit your feedback directly to our product engineering team.

Can I make a guest user a limited administrator?,"Absolutely. For more information, see  Adding guest users to a role .","For more granular administrative control in Microsoft Entra ID, you can assign users to a Microsoft Entra role with a scope that is limited to one or more administrative units. For sample PowerShell scripts for common tasks, seeWork with administrative units. You must be assigned at least thePrivileged Role Administratorrole to create an administrative unit in Microsoft Entra ID. Check to ensure that the user who's trying to create the administrative unit is assigned thePrivileged Role Administratorrole. When you add a group to an administrative unit, that doesn't result in all the group's members being added to it. Users must be directly assigned to the administrative unit. Sometimes, the addition or removal of one or more members of an administrative unit might take a few minutes to be reflected on theAdministrative unitspane. Alternatively, you can go directly to the associated resource's properties and see whether the action has been completed. For more information about members in administrative units, seeList users, groups, or devices in an administrative unit. As an administrator of an administrative unit, you can reset passwords only for users who are assigned to your administrative unit. Make sure that the user whose password reset is failing belongs to the administrative unit to which you've been assigned. If the user belongs to the same administrative unit but you still can't reset the user's password, check the roles that are assigned to the user. To prevent an elevation of privilege, an administrative unit-scoped administrator can't reset the password of a user who's assigned to a role with an organization-wide scope. Security groups have an existing purpose and authorization model. AUser Administrator, for example, can manage membership of all security groups in the Microsoft Entra organization. The role might use groups to manage access to applications such as Salesforce. AUser Administratorshouldn't be able to manage the delegation model itself, which would be the result if security groups were extended to support ""resource grouping"" scenarios. Administrative units, such as organizational units in Windows Server Active Directory, are intended to provide a way to scope administration of a wide range of directory objects. Security groups themselves can be members of resource scopes. Using security groups to define the set of security groups that an administrator can manage could become confusing. Adding a group to an administrative unit brings the group itself into the management scope of the administrative unit, butnotthe members of the group. For more information, seeAdministrative units in Microsoft Entra ID. Yes, a resource can be a member of more than one administrative unit. The resource can be managed by all organization-wide and administrative unit-scoped administrators who have permissions over the resource. No, administrative units aren't available for B2C organizations. No, nested administrative units aren't supported. Yes. You'll find support for administrative units inPowerShell cmdlet documentationandsample scripts. Find support for theadministrativeUnit resource typein Microsoft Graph. The initial update of an administrative unit can take a few minutes depending on your tenant size and the current Microsoft Entra ID load. This usually means there's a problem with the supplied property values. Confirm that the property values you have supplied have a proper value type (Boolean, string, or string collection). For more information, see the allowed values for each operator forusersordevices. This error can also result if a person without a Microsoft Entra ID P1 license attempts to save an update to the administrative unit. To add a single user, add an appropriate expression with theORquery operator to the rule for dynamic membership groups. When an administrative unit has been configured for dynamic membership groups, you must edit the rules for dynamic membership groups to change membership. The total number of dynamic membership groups and dynamic administrative units combined cannot exceed 15,000. Yes. 3,072 characters. No. As an owner of a protected group, you won't be able to manage it just based on ownership. Managing protected resources currently require a role to be assigned at the restricted management administrative unit scope of the protected resource. Currently, securing Microsoft Entra resources in restricted management administrative units is supported. Resources managed outside of Microsoft Entra ID aren't supported. The user, group, or device is a member of restricted management administrative unit. Management rights are limited to administrators scoped to that administrative unit.

Does Microsoft Entra B2B collaboration allow B2B users to access the Microsoft Entra admin center?,"Unless a user is assigned the role of limited administrator, B2B collaboration users won't require access to the Microsoft Entra admin center. However, B2B collaboration users who are assigned the role of limited administrator can access the portal. Also, if a guest user who isn't assigned one of these admin roles accesses the portal, the user might be able to access certain parts of the experience. The guest user role has some permissions in the directory.","Microsoft Entra ID is a cloud-based identity and access management solution. It's a directory and identity management service that operates in the cloud and offers authentication and authorization services to various Microsoft services, such as Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and Microsoft Azure. For more information, seeWhat is Microsoft Entra ID? To access the Microsoft Entra admin center or the Azure portal, each user needs permissions with a valid subscription. If you don't have a paid Microsoft 365 or Microsoft Entra subscription, you need to activate a freeMicrosoft Entra Accountor establish a paid subscription. All Azure subscriptions, whether paid or free, have a trust relationship with a Microsoft Entra tenant. All subscriptions rely on the Microsoft Entra tenant (directory) to authenticate and authorize security principals and devices. For more information, seeHow Azure subscriptions are associated with Microsoft Entra ID. Microsoft Entra ID provides you with common identity and access capabilities to all web services. Whether you're using Microsoft services, such as Microsoft 365, Power Platform, Dynamics 365, or other Microsoft products, you're already using Microsoft Entra ID to help turn on sign-on and access management for all cloud services. All users who are set up to use Microsoft services are defined as user accounts in one or more Microsoft Entra instances, providing these accounts access to Microsoft Entra ID. For more information, seeMicrosoft Entra ID Plans & Pricing Microsoft Entra paid services, such as Enterprise Mobility + Security (Microsoft Enterprise Mobility + Security) complement other Microsoft services like Microsoft 365, with comprehensive enterprise-scale development, management, and security solutions. For more information, see TheMicrosoft Cloud. By default, the person who signs up for a Microsoft Entra or Azure subscription is assigned the Owner role for Azure resources. An Owner can use either a Microsoft account or a work or school account from the directory that the Microsoft Entra or Azure subscription is associated with. This role is also authorized to manage services in the Azure portal. If others need to sign in and access services by using the same subscription, you can assign them the appropriatebuilt-in role. For more information, seeAssign Azure roles using the Azure portal. By default, the user who creates a Microsoft Entra tenant is automatically assigned theGlobal Administratorrole. This user has access to all Microsoft Entra directory features. Microsoft Entra ID has a different set of administrator roles to manage the directory and identity-related features. These administrators have access to various features in the Azure portal. The administrator's role determines what they can do, like create or edit users, assign administrative roles to others, reset user passwords, manage user licenses, or manage domains.

To optimize connectivity between your network and the Microsoft Entra admin center and its services, you might want to add specific Microsoft Entra admin center URLs to your allowlist. Doing so can improve performance and connectivity between your local- or wide area network. Network administrators often deploy proxy servers, firewalls, or other devices, which can help secure and give control over how users access the internet. Rules designed to protect users can sometimes block or slow down legitimate business-related internet traffic. This traffic includes communications between you and Microsoft Entra admin center over the following URLs: For more information, seeUsing Microsoft Entra application proxy to publish on-premises apps for remote users. Additional URLs that you should include are listed in the articleAllow the Azure portal URLs on your firewall or proxy server. You can usually leave an organization on your own without having to contact an administrator. However, in some cases this option isn't available and you need to contact your tenant admin, who can delete your account in the external organization. For more information, seeLeave an organization as an external user. You can connect your on-premises directory to Microsoft Entra ID by using Microsoft Entra Connect. For more information, seeIntegrating your on-premises identities with Microsoft Entra ID. You only need to set up single sign-on (SSO) between your on-premises directory and Microsoft Entra ID. As long as you access your cloud applications through Microsoft Entra ID, the service automatically drives your users to correctly authenticate with their on-premises credentials. Implementing SSO from on-premises can be easily achieved with federation solutions such as Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), or by configuring password hash sync. You can easily deploy both options by using the Microsoft Entra Connect configuration wizard. For more information, seeIntegrating your on-premises identities with Microsoft Entra ID.

(For example, is it possible to use Microsoft Entra self-service password reset (SSPR) with password write-back and not store passwords in the cloud?) This example scenario doesn't require the on-premises password to be tracked in Microsoft Entra. This is because you don't need to synchronize your Active Directory passwords to Microsoft Entra ID to enable write-back. In a federated environment, Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) relies on the on-premises directory to authenticate the user. Password write-back operates in real time. For more information, seeGetting started with password management. Yes, if you have password write-back enabled, the password operations performed by an admin are written back to your on-premises environment. For more answers to password-related questions, seePassword management frequently asked questions. There are a couple of options. You can use the self-service password reset (SSPR) if it's available. Whether SSPR works depends on how it's configured.  For more information about resetting Microsoft Entra passwords, seeHow does the password reset portal work. For Microsoft 365 users, your admin can reset the password by using the steps outlined inReset user passwords. For Microsoft Entra accounts, admins can reset passwords by using one of the following: Microsoft Entra ID uses a more sophisticated strategy to lock accounts. This is based on the IP of the request and the passwords entered. The duration of the lockout also increases based on the likelihood that it's an attack. Rejected passwords return the message 'This password has been used too many times'. This refers to passwords that are globally common, such as any variants of ""Password"" and ""123456"".

Do you support password reset for Microsoft Entra B2B collaboration users?,"If your Microsoft Entra tenant is the home directory for a user, you can  reset the user's password  from the Microsoft Entra admin center. But you can't directly reset a password for a guest user who signs in with an account that's managed by another Microsoft Entra directory or external identity provider. Only the guest user or an administrator in the userâs home directory can reset the password. Here are some examples of how password reset works for guest users: 
 
 Guest users in a Microsoft Entra tenant that are marked ""Guest"" (UserType==Guest) can't register for SSPR through  https://aka.ms/ssprsetup . These type of guest user can only perform SSPR through  https://aka.ms/sspr . 
 
 Guest users who sign in with a Microsoft account (for example guestuser@live.com) can reset their own passwords using Microsoft account self-service password reset (SSPR). See  How to reset your Microsoft account password . 
 
 Guest users who sign in with a Google account or another external identity provider can reset their own passwords using their identity provider's SSPR method. For example, a guest user with the Google account guestuser@gmail.com can reset their password by following the instructions in  Change or reset your password . 
 
 If the identity tenant is a just-in-time (JIT) or ""viral"" tenant (meaning it's a separate, unmanaged Azure tenant), only the guest user can reset their password. Sometimes an organization will  take over management of viral tenants  that are created when employees use their work email addresses to sign up for services. After the organization takes over a viral tenant, only an administrator in that organization can reset the user's password or enable SSPR. If necessary, as the inviting organization, you can remove the guest user account from your directory and resend an invitation. 
 
 If the guest user's home directory is your Microsoft Entra tenant, you can reset the user's password. For example, you might have created a user or synced a user from your on-premises Active Directory and set their UserType to Guest. Because this user is homed in your directory, you can reset their password from the Microsoft Entra admin center.

on which specific clouds are supported. Microsoft Entra Domain Servicesdoesn't currently support Windows LAPS. Windows LAPS passwords are always protected in transit (https) when sent from the managed device to the
cloud. Windows LAPS passwords that are stored in the cloud are always encrypted with AES256. The decryption
keys are only available to those internal Microsoft Entra services that have a technical need to actually handle
the clear-text passwords, for example during storage or query operations. This encryption layer is specific
to Windows LAPS passwords, and is always enabled in addition to the default Microsoft Entra data protection
mechanisms - seeMicrosoft Entra Data Security Considerations. The Windows LAPS CSP rejects MDM configuration directives when the device doesn't appear to be joined.
The CSP logs an event ID 20000 in the Windows LAPS operational event log when this condition occurs.
You might see one or more of these events during the technician flow phase of an Autopilot pre-provisioning
workflow, when Autopilot unjoins the device from Microsoft Entra. This situation gets resolved during the later user flow phase of Autopilot provisioning when the device
is rejoined to Microsoft Entra. At that point Windows LAPS is fully functional and starts backing up
passwords to Microsoft Entra. This issue doesn't affect other Autopilot scenarios aside from pre-provisioning. The CSP warning events
should be ignored when seen in an Autopilot pre-provisioning workflow as described earlier.

It's a directory and identity management service that operates in the cloud and offers authentication and authorization services to various Microsoft services, such as Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and Microsoft Azure. For more information, seeWhat is Microsoft Entra ID? To access the Microsoft Entra admin center or the Azure portal, each user needs permissions with a valid subscription. If you don't have a paid Microsoft 365 or Microsoft Entra subscription, you need to activate a freeMicrosoft Entra Accountor establish a paid subscription. All Azure subscriptions, whether paid or free, have a trust relationship with a Microsoft Entra tenant. All subscriptions rely on the Microsoft Entra tenant (directory) to authenticate and authorize security principals and devices. For more information, seeHow Azure subscriptions are associated with Microsoft Entra ID. Microsoft Entra ID provides you with common identity and access capabilities to all web services. Whether you're using Microsoft services, such as Microsoft 365, Power Platform, Dynamics 365, or other Microsoft products, you're already using Microsoft Entra ID to help turn on sign-on and access management for all cloud services. All users who are set up to use Microsoft services are defined as user accounts in one or more Microsoft Entra instances, providing these accounts access to Microsoft Entra ID. For more information, seeMicrosoft Entra ID Plans & Pricing Microsoft Entra paid services, such as Enterprise Mobility + Security (Microsoft Enterprise Mobility + Security) complement other Microsoft services like Microsoft 365, with comprehensive enterprise-scale development, management, and security solutions. For more information, see TheMicrosoft Cloud. By default, the person who signs up for a Microsoft Entra or Azure subscription is assigned the Owner role for Azure resources. An Owner can use either a Microsoft account or a work or school account from the directory that the Microsoft Entra or Azure subscription is associated with. This role is also authorized to manage services in the Azure portal. If others need to sign in and access services by using the same subscription, you can assign them the appropriatebuilt-in role. For more information, seeAssign Azure roles using the Azure portal. By default, the user who creates a Microsoft Entra tenant is automatically assigned theGlobal Administratorrole. This user has access to all Microsoft Entra directory features. Microsoft Entra ID has a different set of administrator roles to manage the directory and identity-related features. These administrators have access to various features in the Azure portal. The administrator's role determines what they can do, like create or edit users, assign administrative roles to others, reset user passwords, manage user licenses, or manage domains. For more information, seeAssign a user to administrator roles in Microsoft Entra IDandAssigning administrator roles in Microsoft Entra ID. No.  This isn't currently available. To optimize connectivity between your network and the Microsoft Entra admin center and its services, you might want to add specific Microsoft Entra admin center URLs to your allowlist. Doing so can improve performance and connectivity between your local- or wide area network. Network administrators often deploy proxy servers, firewalls, or other devices, which can help secure and give control over how users access the internet. Rules designed to protect users can sometimes block or slow down legitimate business-related internet traffic. This traffic includes communications between you and Microsoft Entra admin center over the following URLs: For more information, seeUsing Microsoft Entra application proxy to publish on-premises apps for remote users. Additional URLs that you should include are listed in the articleAllow the Azure portal URLs on your firewall or proxy server. You can usually leave an organization on your own without having to contact an administrator. However, in some cases this option isn't available and you need to contact your tenant admin, who can delete your account in the external organization. For more information, seeLeave an organization as an external user. You can connect your on-premises directory to Microsoft Entra ID by using Microsoft Entra Connect. For more information, seeIntegrating your on-premises identities with Microsoft Entra ID. You only need to set up single sign-on (SSO) between your on-premises directory and Microsoft Entra ID. As long as you access your cloud applications through Microsoft Entra ID, the service automatically drives your users to correctly authenticate with their on-premises credentials. Implementing SSO from on-premises can be easily achieved with federation solutions such as Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), or by configuring password hash sync. You can easily deploy both options by using the Microsoft Entra Connect configuration wizard. For more information, seeIntegrating your on-premises identities with Microsoft Entra ID.

For more information, seeMonitor your on-premises identity infrastructure and synchronization services in the cloud. (For example, is it possible to use Microsoft Entra self-service password reset (SSPR) with password write-back and not store passwords in the cloud?) This example scenario doesn't require the on-premises password to be tracked in Microsoft Entra. This is because you don't need to synchronize your Active Directory passwords to Microsoft Entra ID to enable write-back. In a federated environment, Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) relies on the on-premises directory to authenticate the user. Password write-back operates in real time. For more information, seeGetting started with password management. Yes, if you have password write-back enabled, the password operations performed by an admin are written back to your on-premises environment. For more answers to password-related questions, seePassword management frequently asked questions. There are a couple of options. You can use the self-service password reset (SSPR) if it's available. Whether SSPR works depends on how it's configured.  For more information about resetting Microsoft Entra passwords, seeHow does the password reset portal work. For Microsoft 365 users, your admin can reset the password by using the steps outlined inReset user passwords. For Microsoft Entra accounts, admins can reset passwords by using one of the following: Microsoft Entra ID uses a more sophisticated strategy to lock accounts. This is based on the IP of the request and the passwords entered. The duration of the lockout also increases based on the likelihood that it's an attack. Rejected passwords return the message 'This password has been used too many times'. This refers to passwords that are globally common, such as any variants of ""Password"" and ""123456"". We do have a gateway that filters requests and provides some protection from botnets, and is applied for all B2C tenants. Microsoft Entra ID has more than 2,600 pre-integrated applications from Microsoft, application service providers, and partners. All pre-integrated applications support single sign-on (SSO). SSO lets you use your organizational credentials to access your apps. Some of the applications also support automated provisioning and de-provisioning. For a complete list of the pre-integrated applications, see theAzure Marketplace. With Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2, you can add and configure any application that you want.

This Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) article is intended to help you learn more about Windows Hello for Business. Windows Hellois an authentication technology that allows users to sign in to their Windows devices using biometric data, or a PIN, instead of a traditional password. Windows Hello for Businessis an extension of Windows Hello that provides enterprise-grade security and management capabilities, including device attestation, certificate-based authentication, and conditional access policies. Policy settings can be deployed to devices to ensure they're secure and compliant with organizational requirements. Three main reasons: The statementA PIN is stronger than a passwordis not directed at the strength of the entropy used by the PIN. It's about the difference between providing entropy versus continuing the use of a symmetric key (the password). The TPM has anti-hammering features that thwart brute-force PIN attacks (an attacker's continuous attempt to try all combination of PINs). Some organizations may worry about shoulder surfing. For those organizations, rather than increase the complexity of the PIN, implement theMultifactor Unlockfeature. To compromise a Windows Hello credential that TPM protects, an attacker must have access to the physical device. Then, the attacker must find a way to spoof the user's biometrics or guess the PIN. All these actions must be done beforeTPM anti-hammeringprotection locks the device. Windows Hello enables biometric sign-in with fingerprint, iris, or facial recognition. When you set up Windows Hello, you're asked to create a PIN after the biometric setup. The PIN enables you to sign in when you can't use your preferred biometric because of an injury or because the sensor is unavailable or not working properly.
If you only had a biometric sign-in configured and, for any reason, were unable to use that method to sign in, you would have to sign in using your account and password, which doesn't provide you with the same level of protection as Hello. Anytime key material is generated, it must be protected against attack. The most robust way to do this is through specialized hardware. There's a long history of using hardware security modules (HSMs) to generate, store, and process keys for security-critical applications. Smart cards are a special type of HSM, as are devices that are compliant with the Trusted Computing Group TPM standard. Wherever possible, the Windows Hello for Business implementation takes advantage of onboard TPM hardware to generate and protect keys. Administrators can choose to allow key operations in software, but it's recommended the use of TPM hardware. The TPM protects against a variety of known and potential attacks, including PIN brute-force attacks. The TPM provides an additional layer of protection after an account lockout, too. When the TPM has locked the key material, the user will have to reset the PIN (which means the user will have to use MFA to reauthenticate to the IdP before the IdP allows re-registration). Resetting the PIN means that all keys and certificates encrypted with the old key material will be removed. Windows Hello for Business provides a PIN caching user experience by using a ticketing system. Rather than caching a PIN, processes cache a ticket they can use to request private key operations. Microsoft Entra ID and Active Directory sign-in keys are cached under lock. This means the keys remain available for use without prompting, as long as the user is interactively signed-in. Microsoft Account sign-in keys are transactional keys, which means the user is always prompted when accessing the key. Windows Hello for Business used as a smart card (smart card emulation that is enabled by default) provides the same user experience of default smart card PIN caching. Each process requesting a private key operation prompts the user for the PIN on first use. Subsequent private key operations won't prompt the user for the PIN. The smart card emulation feature of Windows Hello for Business verifies the PIN and then discards the PIN in exchange for a ticket. The process doesn't receive the PIN, but rather the ticket that grants them private key operations. There isn't a policy setting to adjust the caching. When you enroll in Windows Hello, a representation of your biometrics, called an enrollment profile, is created. The enrollment profile biometrics data is device specific, is stored locally on the device, and does not leave the device or roam with the user. Some external fingerprint sensors store biometric data on the fingerprint module itself rather than on Windows device. Even in this case, the biometrics data is stored locally on those modules, is device specific, doesn't roam, never leaves the module, and is never sent to Microsoft cloud or external server. For more details, seeWindows Hello biometrics in the enterpriseandWindows Hello face authentication. Windows Hello biometrics data is stored on the device as an encrypted template database. The data from the biometrics sensor (like face camera or fingerprint reader) creates a data representationâ€”or graphâ€”that is then encrypted before it's stored on the device. Each biometrics sensor on the device which is used by Windows Hello (face or fingerprint) will have its own biometric database file where template data is stored. Each biometrics database file is encrypted with unique, randomly generated key that is encrypted to the system using AES encryption producing an SHA256 hash. Since Windows Hello biometrics data is stored in encrypted format, no user, or any process other than Windows Hello has access to it. Windows Hello biometrics template database file is created on the device only when a user is enrolled into Windows Hello biometrics-based authentication. An IT administrator may configure policy settings, but it's always a user's choice if they want to use biometrics or PIN. Users can check their current enrollment into Windows Hello biometrics by going to sign-in options on their device. Go toStart > Settings > Accounts > Sign-inoptions. If you don't see Windows Hello in Sign-in options, then it may not be available for your device or blocked by admin via policy. Admins can request users to enroll into Windows Hello during Autopilot or during the initial setup of the device. Admins can disallow users to enroll into biometrics via Windows Hello for Business policy configurations. However, when allowed via policy configurations, enrollment into Windows Hello biometrics is always optional for users. To remove Windows Hello and any associated biometric identification data from the device, openStart > Settings > Accounts > Sign-in options. Select the Windows Hello biometrics authentication method you want to remove, and then selectRemove. The action unenrolls from Windows Hello biometrics authentication and deletes the associated biometrics template database file. For more details, seeWindows sign-in options and account protection (microsoft.com). Starting in Configuration Manager, version 2203, Windows Hello for Business deployments using Configuration Manager are no longer supported. You can delete the Windows Hello for Business container by executing the commandcertutil.exe -deleteHelloContainer. If the user can sign in with a password, they can reset their PIN by selecting theI forgot my PINlink in the Settings app or from the lock screen, by selecting theI forgot my PINlink on the PIN credential provider. For on-premises deployments, devices must be connected to their on-premises network (domain controllers and/or certificate authority) to reset their PINs. Hybrid deployments can onboard their Microsoft Entra tenant to use theWindows Hello for Business PIN reset serviceto reset their PINs. Non-destructive PIN reset works without access to the corporate network. Destructive PIN reset requires access to the corporate network. For more details about destructive and non-destructive PIN reset, seePIN reset. Yes. Our simple PIN algorithm looks for and disallows any PIN that has a constant delta from one digit to the next. The algorithm counts the number of steps required to reach the next digit, overflowing at 10 ('zero').
So, for example: This check prevents repeating numbers, sequential numbers, and simple patterns. It always results in a list of 100 disallowed PINs (independent of the PIN length). This algorithm doesn't apply to alphanumeric PINs. To help Microsoft keep things working properly, to help detecting and preventing fraud, and to continue improving Windows Hello, diagnostic data about how people use Windows Hello is collected. For example: No. The movement away from passwords is accomplished by gradually reducing the use of the password. In situations where you can't authenticate by using biometrics, you need a fallback mechanism that isn't a password. The PIN is the fallback mechanism. Disabling or hiding the PIN credential provider will disable the use of biometrics. The unauthorized user won't be able to utilize any biometric options and will have the only option to enter a PIN. If the user attempts to unlock the device by entering random PINs, after three unsuccessful attempts the credential provider will display the following message:You've entered an incorrect PIN several times. To try again, enter A1B2C3 below.
Upon entering the challenge phraseA1B2C3, the user will be granted one more opportunity to enter the PIN. If unsuccessful, the provider will be disabled, leaving the user with the only option to reboot the device. Following the reboot, the aforementioned pattern repeats. If unsuccessful attempts continue, the device will enter a lockout state, lasting for 1 minute after the first reboot, 2 minutes after the fourth reboot, and 10 minutes after the fifth reboot. The duration of each lockout increases accordingly. This behavior is a result of the TPM 2.0 anti-hammering feature.
For more information about the TPM anti-hammering feature, seeTPM 2.0 anti-hammering. Yes. You can use the on-premises Windows Hello for Business deployment and combine it with a non-Microsoft MFA provider that doesn't require internet connectivity to achieve an air-gapped Windows Hello for Business deployment. The maximum number of supported enrollments on a single device is 10. This lets 10 users each enroll their face and up to 10 fingerprints. For devices with more than 10 users, or for users that sign-in to many devices (for example, a support technician), it's recommended the use of FIDO2 security keys. No. If your organization is using Microsoft cloud services, then you must use a hybrid deployment model. On-premises deployments are exclusive to organizations who need more time before moving to the cloud and exclusively use Active Directory. ReviewMicrosoft Entra Connect Sync: Attributes synchronized to Microsoft Entra IDfor a list of attributes that sync based on scenarios. The base scenarios that include Windows Hello for Business are theWindows 10scenario and theDevice writebackscenario. Your environment may include other attributes. Yes, if you're using federated hybrid deployment, you can use any non-Microsoft that provides an AD FS MFA adapter. A list of non-Microsoft MFA adapters can be foundhere. Windows Hello for Business works with any non-Microsoft federation servers that support the protocols used during the provisioning experience. Windows Hello for Business is not designed to work with local accounts. ReadWindows Hello biometric requirementsfor more information. Wearing a mask to enroll is a security concern because other users wearing a similar mask may be able to unlock your device. Remove a mask if you're wearing one when you enroll or unlock with Windows Hello face authentication. If your working environment doesn't allow you to remove a mask temporarily, consider un-enrolling from face authentication and only using PIN or fingerprint. A user will be prompted to set up a Windows Hello for Business key on a Microsoft Entra registered devices if the feature is enabled by policy. If the user has an existing Windows Hello container, the Windows Hello for Business key will be enrolled in that container and will be protected using existing gestures. If a user has signed into their Microsoft Entra registered device with Windows Hello, their Windows Hello for Business key will be used to authenticate the user's work identity when they try to use Microsoft Entra resources. The Windows Hello for Business key meets Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication (MFA) requirements and reduces the number of MFA prompts users will see when accessing resources. It's possible to Microsoft Entra register a domain joined device. If the domain joined device has a convenience PIN, sign in with the convenience PIN will no longer work. This configuration isn't supported by Windows Hello for Business. For more information, seeMicrosoft Entra registered devices. Windows Hello for Business is a feature of the Windows platform. No, Microsoft Entra Domain Services is a separately managed environment in Azure, and hybrid device registration with cloud Microsoft Entra ID isn't available for it via Microsoft Entra Connect. Hence, Windows Hello for Business doesn't work with Microsoft Entra Domain Services. Windows Hello for Business is two-factor authentication based on the observed authentication factors of:something you have,something you know, andsomething that's part of you. Windows Hello for Business incorporates two of these factors: something you have (the user's private key protected by the device's security module) and something you know (your PIN). With the proper hardware, you can enhance the user experience by introducing biometrics. By using biometrics, you can replace the ""something you know"" authentication factor with the ""something that is part of you"" factor, with the assurances that users can fall back to the ""something you know factor"". Note The Windows Hello for Business key meets Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication (MFA) requirements and reduces the number of MFA prompts users will see when accessing resources. For more information, seeWhat is a Primary Refresh Token. Both types of authentication provide the same security; one is not more secure than the other.
The trust models of your deployment determine how you authenticate to Active Directory. Both key trust and certificate trust use the same hardware-backed, two-factor credential. The difference between the two trust types is the issuance of end-entity certificates: Convenience PINprovides a simpler way to sign in to Windows than passwords, but it still uses a password for authentication. When the correct convenience PIN is provided to Windows, the password information is loaded from its cache and authenticates the user. Organizations using convenience PINs should move toWindows Hello for Business. New Windows deployments should deploy Windows Hello for Business and not convenience PINs. No. While it's possible to set a convenience PIN on Microsoft Entra joined and Microsoft Entra hybrid joined devices, convenience PIN isn't supported for Microsoft Entra user accounts (including synchronized identities). Convenience PIN is only supported for on-premises Active Directory users and local account users. Windows Hello for Business is the modern, two-factor authentication for Windows. Customers using virtual smart cards are strongly encouraged to move to Windows Hello for Business. For a list of required URLs, seeMicrosoft 365 Common and Office Online. If your environment uses Microsoft Intune, seeNetwork endpoints for Microsoft Intune. Yes, you can use an external Windows Hello compatible camera if a device has an internal Windows Hello camera. When both cameras are present, the external camera is used for face authentication. For more information, seeIT tools to support Windows 10, version 21H1. If ESS is enabled, seeWindows Hello Enhanced Sign-in Security. Some laptops and tablets with keyboards that close may not use an external Windows Hello compatible camera or other Windows Hello compatible accessory when the computer is docked with the lid closed. The issue has been addressed in Windows 11, version 22H2. Windows Hello for Business credentials need access to device state, which is not available in private browser mode or incognito mode. Hence it can't be used in private browser or Incognito mode. You can usemultifactor unlockto require users to provide an extra factor to unlock their device. Authentication remains two-factor, but another factor is required before Windows allows the user to reach the desktop. To learn more, seeMultifactor Unlock. Windows Hello for Businesscloud Kerberos trustis atrust modelthat enables Windows Hello for Business deployment using the infrastructure introduced for supportingsecurity key sign-in on Microsoft Entra hybrid joined devices and on-premises resource access on Microsoft Entra joined devices. Cloud Kerberos trust is the preferred deployment model if you do not need to support certificate authentication scenarios. For more information, seecloud Kerberos trust deployment. This feature doesn't work in a pure on-premises AD domain services environment. Windows Hello for Business cloud Kerberos trust functions correctly when the client authenticates directly to a writable domain controller or to a Read-Only Domain Controller (RODC) that doesn't cache the user's credentials, in accordance with the Password Replication Policy. If the client attempts to authenticate to an RODC that can cache the user's credentials, cloud Kerberos trust authentication might fail. To mitigate this, deploy KDC certificates to all RODCs to support Windows Hello for Business key trust authentication, which is also required for those RODCs to support LDAP over SSL. This configuration ensures that authentication can seamlessly failover to Windows Hello for Business key trust authentication, thereby guaranteeing successful user authentication. Windows Hello for Business cloud Kerberos trust requires line of sight to a domain controller when: Windows Hello for Business cloud Kerberos trust can't be used as a supplied credential with RDP/VDI. Similar to key trust, cloud Kerberos trust can be used for RDP if acertificate is enrolled into Windows Hello for Businessfor this purpose. As an alternative, consider usingRemote Credential Guardwhich doesn't require to deploy certificates. No, only the number necessary to handle the load from all cloud Kerberos trust devices. In a hybrid deployment, a user's public key must sync from Microsoft Entra ID to Active Directory before it can be used to authenticate against a domain controller. This sync is handled by Microsoft Entra Connect and will occur during a normal sync cycle. Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) doesn't support using key-based authentication as supplied credentials. However, you can deploy certificates in the key trust model to enable RDP. For more information, seeDeploying certificates to key trust users to enable RDP. As an alternative, consider usingRemote Credential Guardwhich doesn't require to deploy certificates.

Can an Azure AD B2C local account be invited to a Microsoft Entra tenant for B2B collaboration?,No. An Azure AD B2C local account can only be used to sign in to the Azure AD B2C tenant. The account can't be used to sign into a Microsoft Entra tenant. Inviting an Azure AD B2C local account to a Microsoft Entra tenant for B2B collaboration isn't supported.,"Microsoft Entra ID is a cloud-based identity and access management solution. It's a directory and identity management service that operates in the cloud and offers authentication and authorization services to various Microsoft services, such as Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and Microsoft Azure. For more information, seeWhat is Microsoft Entra ID? To access the Microsoft Entra admin center or the Azure portal, each user needs permissions with a valid subscription. If you don't have a paid Microsoft 365 or Microsoft Entra subscription, you need to activate a freeMicrosoft Entra Accountor establish a paid subscription. All Azure subscriptions, whether paid or free, have a trust relationship with a Microsoft Entra tenant. All subscriptions rely on the Microsoft Entra tenant (directory) to authenticate and authorize security principals and devices. For more information, seeHow Azure subscriptions are associated with Microsoft Entra ID. Microsoft Entra ID provides you with common identity and access capabilities to all web services. Whether you're using Microsoft services, such as Microsoft 365, Power Platform, Dynamics 365, or other Microsoft products, you're already using Microsoft Entra ID to help turn on sign-on and access management for all cloud services. All users who are set up to use Microsoft services are defined as user accounts in one or more Microsoft Entra instances, providing these accounts access to Microsoft Entra ID. For more information, seeMicrosoft Entra ID Plans & Pricing Microsoft Entra paid services, such as Enterprise Mobility + Security (Microsoft Enterprise Mobility + Security) complement other Microsoft services like Microsoft 365, with comprehensive enterprise-scale development, management, and security solutions. For more information, see TheMicrosoft Cloud. By default, the person who signs up for a Microsoft Entra or Azure subscription is assigned the Owner role for Azure resources. An Owner can use either a Microsoft account or a work or school account from the directory that the Microsoft Entra or Azure subscription is associated with. This role is also authorized to manage services in the Azure portal. If others need to sign in and access services by using the same subscription, you can assign them the appropriatebuilt-in role. For more information, seeAssign Azure roles using the Azure portal. By default, the user who creates a Microsoft Entra tenant is automatically assigned theGlobal Administratorrole. This user has access to all Microsoft Entra directory features. Microsoft Entra ID has a different set of administrator roles to manage the directory and identity-related features. These administrators have access to various features in the Azure portal. The administrator's role determines what they can do, like create or edit users, assign administrative roles to others, reset user passwords, manage user licenses, or manage domains. For more information, seeAssign a user to administrator roles in Microsoft Entra IDandAssigning administrator roles in Microsoft Entra ID. No.  This isn't currently available. To optimize connectivity between your network and the Microsoft Entra admin center and its services, you might want to add specific Microsoft Entra admin center URLs to your allowlist. Doing so can improve performance and connectivity between your local- or wide area network. Network administrators often deploy proxy servers, firewalls, or other devices, which can help secure and give control over how users access the internet. Rules designed to protect users can sometimes block or slow down legitimate business-related internet traffic. This traffic includes communications between you and Microsoft Entra admin center over the following URLs: For more information, seeUsing Microsoft Entra application proxy to publish on-premises apps for remote users. Additional URLs that you should include are listed in the articleAllow the Azure portal URLs on your firewall or proxy server. You can usually leave an organization on your own without having to contact an administrator. However, in some cases this option isn't available and you need to contact your tenant admin, who can delete your account in the external organization. For more information, seeLeave an organization as an external user. You can connect your on-premises directory to Microsoft Entra ID by using Microsoft Entra Connect. For more information, seeIntegrating your on-premises identities with Microsoft Entra ID. You only need to set up single sign-on (SSO) between your on-premises directory and Microsoft Entra ID. As long as you access your cloud applications through Microsoft Entra ID, the service automatically drives your users to correctly authenticate with their on-premises credentials. Implementing SSO from on-premises can be easily achieved with federation solutions such as Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), or by configuring password hash sync. You can easily deploy both options by using the Microsoft Entra Connect configuration wizard. For more information, seeIntegrating your on-premises identities with Microsoft Entra ID. Yes, Microsoft Entra ID provides you with theMicrosoft Entra ID Access Panelfor user self-service and application access. If you're a Microsoft 365 customer, you can find many of the same capabilities in theOffice 365 portal. For more information, seeIntroduction to the Access Panel. Yes. The Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 edition provides you with Microsoft Entra Connect Health. Microsoft Entra Connect Health helps you monitor and gain insight into your on-premises identity infrastructure and the synchronization services. For more information, seeMonitor your on-premises identity infrastructure and synchronization services in the cloud. (For example, is it possible to use Microsoft Entra self-service password reset (SSPR) with password write-back and not store passwords in the cloud?) This example scenario doesn't require the on-premises password to be tracked in Microsoft Entra. This is because you don't need to synchronize your Active Directory passwords to Microsoft Entra ID to enable write-back. In a federated environment, Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) relies on the on-premises directory to authenticate the user. Password write-back operates in real time. For more information, seeGetting started with password management. Yes, if you have password write-back enabled, the password operations performed by an admin are written back to your on-premises environment. For more answers to password-related questions, seePassword management frequently asked questions. There are a couple of options. You can use the self-service password reset (SSPR) if it's available. Whether SSPR works depends on how it's configured.  For more information about resetting Microsoft Entra passwords, seeHow does the password reset portal work. For Microsoft 365 users, your admin can reset the password by using the steps outlined inReset user passwords. For Microsoft Entra accounts, admins can reset passwords by using one of the following: Microsoft Entra ID uses a more sophisticated strategy to lock accounts. This is based on the IP of the request and the passwords entered. The duration of the lockout also increases based on the likelihood that it's an attack. Rejected passwords return the message 'This password has been used too many times'. This refers to passwords that are globally common, such as any variants of ""Password"" and ""123456"". We do have a gateway that filters requests and provides some protection from botnets, and is applied for all B2C tenants. Microsoft Entra ID has more than 2,600 pre-integrated applications from Microsoft, application service providers, and partners. All pre-integrated applications support single sign-on (SSO). SSO lets you use your organizational credentials to access your apps. Some of the applications also support automated provisioning and de-provisioning. For a complete list of the pre-integrated applications, see theAzure Marketplace. With Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2, you can add and configure any application that you want. Depending on your application's capabilities and your preferences, you can configure SSO and automated provisioning. For more information, seeSingle sign-on SAML protocolandDevelop and plan provisioning for a SCIM endpoint. Microsoft Entra ID provides several ways for users to view and access their applications, such as: For more information, seeEnd user experiences for applications. Microsoft Entra ID supports many standardized protocols for authentication and authorization, such as SAML 2.0, OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, and WS-Federation. Microsoft Entra ID also supports password vaulting and automated sign-in capabilities for apps that only support forms-based authentication. For more information, seeIdentity fundamentalsandSingle sign-on for applications in Microsoft Entra ID. Microsoft Entra application proxyprovides you with easy and secure access to on-premises web applications that you choose. You can access these applications in the same way that you access your software as a service (SaaS) apps in Microsoft Entra ID. There's no need for a VPN or to change your network infrastructure. For more information, seeHow to provide secure remote access to on-premises applications. WithMicrosoft Entra Conditional Access, you can assign a unique access policy for each application. In your policy, you can require multifactor authentication always, or when users aren't connected to the local network. For more information, seeSecuring access to Microsoft 365 and other apps connected to Microsoft Entra ID. Use Microsoft Entra ID to automate the creation, maintenance, and removal of user identities in many popular cloud SaaS apps. For more information, seeWhat is app provisioning in Microsoft Entra ID?. No. Microsoft Entra ID doesn't support the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) protocol or Secure LDAP directly. However, it's possible to enable Microsoft Entra Domain Services instance on your Microsoft Entra tenant with properly configured network security groups through Azure Networking to achieve LDAP connectivity.

What applications and services support Azure B2B guest users?,"All Microsoft Entra integrated applications can support Azure B2B guest users, but they must use an endpoint set up as a tenant to authenticate guest users. You might also need to  customize the claims  in the SAML token that is issued when a guest user authenticates to the app.","This article answers frequently asked questions and explains best practices for Azure Virtual Desktop. If you want to create host pools and other objects, you must be assigned the Contributor role on the subscription or resource group you're working with. You must be assigned the User Access Admin role on an application group to publish application groups to users or user groups. To restrict an admin to only manage user sessions, such as sending messages to users, signing out users, and so on, you can create custom roles. For example: Users must be in the same Microsoft Entra tenant as their assigned workspace, host pool, and app group. Having everything in the same tenant lets you assign users to proper role-based access control (RBAC) roles so they can access their resources. However, you can deploy virtual machines (VMs) in a different Microsoft Entra tenant if they're joined to either the same AD as the user or an AD that has a trust relationship with the user's AD. All service resources have a location associated with them. A host pool's location determines which geography the service metadata for the host pool is stored in. An application group can't exist without a host pool. If you add apps to a RemoteApp application group, you also need a session host to determine the start menu apps. For any application group action, you'll also need a related data access on the host pool. To make sure data isn't being transferred between multiple locations, the application group's location should be the same as the host pool's. Workspaces also must be in the same location as their application groups. Whenever the workspace updates, the related application group updates along with it. Like with application groups, the service requires that all workspaces are associated with application groups created in the same location. When you run a PowerShell cmdlet, you only see the resource name and location. For example: To see all of a resource's properties, add eitherformat-listorflto the end of the cmdlet. For example: To see specific properties, add the specific property names afterformat-listorfl. For example: Azure Virtual Desktop doesn't support Microsoft Entra guest user accounts. For example, let's say a group of guest users have Microsoft 365 E3 Per-user, Windows E3 Per-user, or WIN VDA licenses in their own company, but are guest users in a different company's Microsoft Entra ID. The other company would manage the guest users' user objects in both Microsoft Entra ID and Active Directory like local accounts. You can't use your own licenses for the benefit of a third-party. Also, Azure Virtual Desktop doesn't currently support Microsoft Account (MSA). We don't currently have a reliable way to collect the web client's IP addresses, so we don't include that value in the table. There are multiple options in Azure Virtual Desktop for handling backup. At the Compute level, backup is recommended only for Personal Host Pools throughAzure Backup. At the Storage level, recommended backup solution varies based on the backend storage used to store user profiles. If Azure Files Share is used,Azure Backup for File Shareis recommended. If Azure NetApp Files is used,Snaphots/PoliciesorAzure NetApp Files Backupare tools available. Azure Virtual Desktop is currently optimized for Teams. Microsoft currently doesn't support third-party collaboration apps like Zoom. Third-party organizations are responsible for giving compatibility guidelines to their customers. Azure Virtual Desktop also doesn't support Skype for Business. Once you create a host pool, you can't change its type. However, you can move any VMs you register to a host pool to a different type of host pool. These factors can affect scale limit for host pools: The Azure template is limited to 800 objects. To learn more, seeAzure subscription and service limits, quotas, and constraints. Each VM also creates about six objects, so that means you can create around 132 VMs each time you run the template. There are restrictions on how many vCPUs you can create per region and per subscription. For example, if you have an Enterprise Agreement subscription, by default you can create 350 vCPUs. You need to divide 350 by either the default number of vCPUs per VM or your own vCPU limit to determine how many VMs you can create each time you run the template. Learn more atVirtual Machines limits - Azure Resource ManagerandCheck vCPU quotas. The VM prefix name can't exceed 11 characters, so that when a sequential number is added the total name is a maximum of 15 characters. To learn more, seeNaming rules and restrictions for Azure resources. Azure Lighthouse doesn't fully support managing Azure Virtual Desktop environments. Since Lighthouse doesn't currently support cross-Microsoft Entra ID tenant user management, Lighthouse customers still need to sign in to the Microsoft Entra ID that customers use to manage users. You also can't use CSP sandbox subscriptions with the Azure Virtual Desktop service. To learn more, seeIntegration sandbox account. Finally, if you enabled the resource provider from the CSP owner account, the CSP customer accounts aren't able to modify the resource provider. After you register a VM to a host pool within the Azure Virtual Desktop service, the agent regularly refreshes the VM's token whenever the VM is active. The certificate for the registration token is valid for 90 days. Because of this 90-day limit, we recommend VMs to be online for 20 minutes every 90 days so that the machine can refresh its tokens and update the agent and side-by-side stack components. Turning on your VM within this time limit prevents its registration token from expiring or becoming invalid. If you started your VM after 90 days and are experiencing registration issues, follow the instructions in theAzure Virtual Desktop agent troubleshooting guideto remove the VM from the host pool, reinstall the agent, and reregister it to the pool. Yes. Azure Virtual Desktop host pools have an option for selecting either availability set or availability zones when you create a VM. These availability options are the same as the ones Azure Compute uses. If you select a zone for the VM you create in a host pool, the setting automatically applies to all VMs you create in that zone. If you'd prefer to spread your host pool VMs across multiple zones, you need to follow the directions inAdd virtual machines with the Azure portalto manually select a new zone for each new VM you create. Make sure thatAzure availability zonesare available in the region where your VMs are located. The availability option you should use for your VMs depends on your image's location. The following table explains the relationship each setting has with these variables to help you figure out which option is best for your deployment. We recommend you use Windows Defender Application Control instead of AppLocker. Yes. You can have both deployments within the same Microsoft Entra tenant. No.Ephemeral OS disks for Azure VMsaren't supported with Azure Virtual Desktop. Metadata of a host pool is replicated within a geography for resiliency. If the region your host pool is in goes down, it fails over to its replica. During this failover period, Azure Virtual Desktop doesn't accept new user connections to the session host VMs in that host pool until the failover is complete. Any existing sessions on the session host VMs in that host pool remain connected and unaffected. To learn more about how service resilience is implemented for Azure Virtual Desktop, seeAzure Virtual Desktop service architecture and resilience. If you try to go over 200 VMs in an availability set in Azure Virtual Desktop, you receive an error message that says ""Can't create VM because the limit of 200 VMs has already been reached."" For more information, see theAvailability sets overview. Session hosts in a pooled host pool aren't supported for in-place upgrade. Session hosts in a personal host pool are supported for in-place upgrade.

Can we force multifactor authentication for B2B guest users if our partners don't have multifactor authentication?,"Yes. For more information, see  Conditional Access for B2B collaboration users .","Windows Hello for Business replaces password sign-in with strong authentication, using an asymmetric key pair. This Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) article is intended to help you learn more about Windows Hello for Business. Windows Hellois an authentication technology that allows users to sign in to their Windows devices using biometric data, or a PIN, instead of a traditional password. Windows Hello for Businessis an extension of Windows Hello that provides enterprise-grade security and management capabilities, including device attestation, certificate-based authentication, and conditional access policies. Policy settings can be deployed to devices to ensure they're secure and compliant with organizational requirements. Three main reasons: The statementA PIN is stronger than a passwordis not directed at the strength of the entropy used by the PIN. It's about the difference between providing entropy versus continuing the use of a symmetric key (the password). The TPM has anti-hammering features that thwart brute-force PIN attacks (an attacker's continuous attempt to try all combination of PINs). Some organizations may worry about shoulder surfing. For those organizations, rather than increase the complexity of the PIN, implement theMultifactor Unlockfeature. To compromise a Windows Hello credential that TPM protects, an attacker must have access to the physical device. Then, the attacker must find a way to spoof the user's biometrics or guess the PIN. All these actions must be done beforeTPM anti-hammeringprotection locks the device. Windows Hello enables biometric sign-in with fingerprint, iris, or facial recognition. When you set up Windows Hello, you're asked to create a PIN after the biometric setup. The PIN enables you to sign in when you can't use your preferred biometric because of an injury or because the sensor is unavailable or not working properly.
If you only had a biometric sign-in configured and, for any reason, were unable to use that method to sign in, you would have to sign in using your account and password, which doesn't provide you with the same level of protection as Hello. Anytime key material is generated, it must be protected against attack. The most robust way to do this is through specialized hardware. There's a long history of using hardware security modules (HSMs) to generate, store, and process keys for security-critical applications. Smart cards are a special type of HSM, as are devices that are compliant with the Trusted Computing Group TPM standard. Wherever possible, the Windows Hello for Business implementation takes advantage of onboard TPM hardware to generate and protect keys. Administrators can choose to allow key operations in software, but it's recommended the use of TPM hardware. The TPM protects against a variety of known and potential attacks, including PIN brute-force attacks. The TPM provides an additional layer of protection after an account lockout, too. When the TPM has locked the key material, the user will have to reset the PIN (which means the user will have to use MFA to reauthenticate to the IdP before the IdP allows re-registration). Resetting the PIN means that all keys and certificates encrypted with the old key material will be removed. Windows Hello for Business provides a PIN caching user experience by using a ticketing system. Rather than caching a PIN, processes cache a ticket they can use to request private key operations. Microsoft Entra ID and Active Directory sign-in keys are cached under lock. This means the keys remain available for use without prompting, as long as the user is interactively signed-in. Microsoft Account sign-in keys are transactional keys, which means the user is always prompted when accessing the key. Windows Hello for Business used as a smart card (smart card emulation that is enabled by default) provides the same user experience of default smart card PIN caching. Each process requesting a private key operation prompts the user for the PIN on first use. Subsequent private key operations won't prompt the user for the PIN. The smart card emulation feature of Windows Hello for Business verifies the PIN and then discards the PIN in exchange for a ticket. The process doesn't receive the PIN, but rather the ticket that grants them private key operations. There isn't a policy setting to adjust the caching. When you enroll in Windows Hello, a representation of your biometrics, called an enrollment profile, is created. The enrollment profile biometrics data is device specific, is stored locally on the device, and does not leave the device or roam with the user. Some external fingerprint sensors store biometric data on the fingerprint module itself rather than on Windows device. Even in this case, the biometrics data is stored locally on those modules, is device specific, doesn't roam, never leaves the module, and is never sent to Microsoft cloud or external server. For more details, seeWindows Hello biometrics in the enterpriseandWindows Hello face authentication. Windows Hello biometrics data is stored on the device as an encrypted template database. The data from the biometrics sensor (like face camera or fingerprint reader) creates a data representationâ€”or graphâ€”that is then encrypted before it's stored on the device. Each biometrics sensor on the device which is used by Windows Hello (face or fingerprint) will have its own biometric database file where template data is stored. Each biometrics database file is encrypted with unique, randomly generated key that is encrypted to the system using AES encryption producing an SHA256 hash. Since Windows Hello biometrics data is stored in encrypted format, no user, or any process other than Windows Hello has access to it. Windows Hello biometrics template database file is created on the device only when a user is enrolled into Windows Hello biometrics-based authentication. An IT administrator may configure policy settings, but it's always a user's choice if they want to use biometrics or PIN. Users can check their current enrollment into Windows Hello biometrics by going to sign-in options on their device. Go toStart > Settings > Accounts > Sign-inoptions. If you don't see Windows Hello in Sign-in options, then it may not be available for your device or blocked by admin via policy. Admins can request users to enroll into Windows Hello during Autopilot or during the initial setup of the device. Admins can disallow users to enroll into biometrics via Windows Hello for Business policy configurations. However, when allowed via policy configurations, enrollment into Windows Hello biometrics is always optional for users. To remove Windows Hello and any associated biometric identification data from the device, openStart > Settings > Accounts > Sign-in options. Select the Windows Hello biometrics authentication method you want to remove, and then selectRemove. The action unenrolls from Windows Hello biometrics authentication and deletes the associated biometrics template database file. For more details, seeWindows sign-in options and account protection (microsoft.com). Starting in Configuration Manager, version 2203, Windows Hello for Business deployments using Configuration Manager are no longer supported. You can delete the Windows Hello for Business container by executing the commandcertutil.exe -deleteHelloContainer. If the user can sign in with a password, they can reset their PIN by selecting theI forgot my PINlink in the Settings app or from the lock screen, by selecting theI forgot my PINlink on the PIN credential provider. For on-premises deployments, devices must be connected to their on-premises network (domain controllers and/or certificate authority) to reset their PINs. Hybrid deployments can onboard their Microsoft Entra tenant to use theWindows Hello for Business PIN reset serviceto reset their PINs. Non-destructive PIN reset works without access to the corporate network. Destructive PIN reset requires access to the corporate network. For more details about destructive and non-destructive PIN reset, seePIN reset. Yes. Our simple PIN algorithm looks for and disallows any PIN that has a constant delta from one digit to the next. The algorithm counts the number of steps required to reach the next digit, overflowing at 10 ('zero').
So, for example: This check prevents repeating numbers, sequential numbers, and simple patterns. It always results in a list of 100 disallowed PINs (independent of the PIN length). This algorithm doesn't apply to alphanumeric PINs. To help Microsoft keep things working properly, to help detecting and preventing fraud, and to continue improving Windows Hello, diagnostic data about how people use Windows Hello is collected. For example: No. The movement away from passwords is accomplished by gradually reducing the use of the password. In situations where you can't authenticate by using biometrics, you need a fallback mechanism that isn't a password. The PIN is the fallback mechanism. Disabling or hiding the PIN credential provider will disable the use of biometrics. The unauthorized user won't be able to utilize any biometric options and will have the only option to enter a PIN. If the user attempts to unlock the device by entering random PINs, after three unsuccessful attempts the credential provider will display the following message:You've entered an incorrect PIN several times. To try again, enter A1B2C3 below.
Upon entering the challenge phraseA1B2C3, the user will be granted one more opportunity to enter the PIN. If unsuccessful, the provider will be disabled, leaving the user with the only option to reboot the device. Following the reboot, the aforementioned pattern repeats. If unsuccessful attempts continue, the device will enter a lockout state, lasting for 1 minute after the first reboot, 2 minutes after the fourth reboot, and 10 minutes after the fifth reboot. The duration of each lockout increases accordingly. This behavior is a result of the TPM 2.0 anti-hammering feature.
For more information about the TPM anti-hammering feature, seeTPM 2.0 anti-hammering. Yes. You can use the on-premises Windows Hello for Business deployment and combine it with a non-Microsoft MFA provider that doesn't require internet connectivity to achieve an air-gapped Windows Hello for Business deployment. The maximum number of supported enrollments on a single device is 10. This lets 10 users each enroll their face and up to 10 fingerprints. For devices with more than 10 users, or for users that sign-in to many devices (for example, a support technician), it's recommended the use of FIDO2 security keys. No. If your organization is using Microsoft cloud services, then you must use a hybrid deployment model. On-premises deployments are exclusive to organizations who need more time before moving to the cloud and exclusively use Active Directory. ReviewMicrosoft Entra Connect Sync: Attributes synchronized to Microsoft Entra IDfor a list of attributes that sync based on scenarios. The base scenarios that include Windows Hello for Business are theWindows 10scenario and theDevice writebackscenario. Your environment may include other attributes. Yes, if you're using federated hybrid deployment, you can use any non-Microsoft that provides an AD FS MFA adapter. A list of non-Microsoft MFA adapters can be foundhere. Windows Hello for Business works with any non-Microsoft federation servers that support the protocols used during the provisioning experience. Windows Hello for Business is not designed to work with local accounts. ReadWindows Hello biometric requirementsfor more information. Wearing a mask to enroll is a security concern because other users wearing a similar mask may be able to unlock your device. Remove a mask if you're wearing one when you enroll or unlock with Windows Hello face authentication. If your working environment doesn't allow you to remove a mask temporarily, consider un-enrolling from face authentication and only using PIN or fingerprint. A user will be prompted to set up a Windows Hello for Business key on a Microsoft Entra registered devices if the feature is enabled by policy. If the user has an existing Windows Hello container, the Windows Hello for Business key will be enrolled in that container and will be protected using existing gestures. If a user has signed into their Microsoft Entra registered device with Windows Hello, their Windows Hello for Business key will be used to authenticate the user's work identity when they try to use Microsoft Entra resources. The Windows Hello for Business key meets Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication (MFA) requirements and reduces the number of MFA prompts users will see when accessing resources. It's possible to Microsoft Entra register a domain joined device. If the domain joined device has a convenience PIN, sign in with the convenience PIN will no longer work. This configuration isn't supported by Windows Hello for Business. For more information, seeMicrosoft Entra registered devices. Windows Hello for Business is a feature of the Windows platform. No, Microsoft Entra Domain Services is a separately managed environment in Azure, and hybrid device registration with cloud Microsoft Entra ID isn't available for it via Microsoft Entra Connect. Hence, Windows Hello for Business doesn't work with Microsoft Entra Domain Services. Windows Hello for Business is two-factor authentication based on the observed authentication factors of:something you have,something you know, andsomething that's part of you. Windows Hello for Business incorporates two of these factors: something you have (the user's private key protected by the device's security module) and something you know (your PIN). With the proper hardware, you can enhance the user experience by introducing biometrics. By using biometrics, you can replace the ""something you know"" authentication factor with the ""something that is part of you"" factor, with the assurances that users can fall back to the ""something you know factor"". Note The Windows Hello for Business key meets Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication (MFA) requirements and reduces the number of MFA prompts users will see when accessing resources. For more information, seeWhat is a Primary Refresh Token. Both types of authentication provide the same security; one is not more secure than the other.
The trust models of your deployment determine how you authenticate to Active Directory. Both key trust and certificate trust use the same hardware-backed, two-factor credential. The difference between the two trust types is the issuance of end-entity certificates: Convenience PINprovides a simpler way to sign in to Windows than passwords, but it still uses a password for authentication. When the correct convenience PIN is provided to Windows, the password information is loaded from its cache and authenticates the user. Organizations using convenience PINs should move toWindows Hello for Business. New Windows deployments should deploy Windows Hello for Business and not convenience PINs. No. While it's possible to set a convenience PIN on Microsoft Entra joined and Microsoft Entra hybrid joined devices, convenience PIN isn't supported for Microsoft Entra user accounts (including synchronized identities). Convenience PIN is only supported for on-premises Active Directory users and local account users. Windows Hello for Business is the modern, two-factor authentication for Windows. Customers using virtual smart cards are strongly encouraged to move to Windows Hello for Business. For a list of required URLs, seeMicrosoft 365 Common and Office Online. If your environment uses Microsoft Intune, seeNetwork endpoints for Microsoft Intune. Yes, you can use an external Windows Hello compatible camera if a device has an internal Windows Hello camera. When both cameras are present, the external camera is used for face authentication. For more information, seeIT tools to support Windows 10, version 21H1. If ESS is enabled, seeWindows Hello Enhanced Sign-in Security. Some laptops and tablets with keyboards that close may not use an external Windows Hello compatible camera or other Windows Hello compatible accessory when the computer is docked with the lid closed. The issue has been addressed in Windows 11, version 22H2. Windows Hello for Business credentials need access to device state, which is not available in private browser mode or incognito mode. Hence it can't be used in private browser or Incognito mode. You can usemultifactor unlockto require users to provide an extra factor to unlock their device. Authentication remains two-factor, but another factor is required before Windows allows the user to reach the desktop. To learn more, seeMultifactor Unlock. Windows Hello for Businesscloud Kerberos trustis atrust modelthat enables Windows Hello for Business deployment using the infrastructure introduced for supportingsecurity key sign-in on Microsoft Entra hybrid joined devices and on-premises resource access on Microsoft Entra joined devices. Cloud Kerberos trust is the preferred deployment model if you do not need to support certificate authentication scenarios. For more information, seecloud Kerberos trust deployment. This feature doesn't work in a pure on-premises AD domain services environment. Windows Hello for Business cloud Kerberos trust functions correctly when the client authenticates directly to a writable domain controller or to a Read-Only Domain Controller (RODC) that doesn't cache the user's credentials, in accordance with the Password Replication Policy. If the client attempts to authenticate to an RODC that can cache the user's credentials, cloud Kerberos trust authentication might fail. To mitigate this, deploy KDC certificates to all RODCs to support Windows Hello for Business key trust authentication, which is also required for those RODCs to support LDAP over SSL. This configuration ensures that authentication can seamlessly failover to Windows Hello for Business key trust authentication, thereby guaranteeing successful user authentication. Windows Hello for Business cloud Kerberos trust requires line of sight to a domain controller when: Windows Hello for Business cloud Kerberos trust can't be used as a supplied credential with RDP/VDI. Similar to key trust, cloud Kerberos trust can be used for RDP if acertificate is enrolled into Windows Hello for Businessfor this purpose. As an alternative, consider usingRemote Credential Guardwhich doesn't require to deploy certificates. No, only the number necessary to handle the load from all cloud Kerberos trust devices. In a hybrid deployment, a user's public key must sync from Microsoft Entra ID to Active Directory before it can be used to authenticate against a domain controller. This sync is handled by Microsoft Entra Connect and will occur during a normal sync cycle. Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) doesn't support using key-based authentication as supplied credentials. However, you can deploy certificates in the key trust model to enable RDP. For more information, seeDeploying certificates to key trust users to enable RDP. As an alternative, consider usingRemote Credential Guardwhich doesn't require to deploy certificates.

Accessing Azure DevOps includes usingOrganizationName.visualstudio.com directly and using resources or services indirectly. For example, you might use theAzure Artifactsextension, or you can push code to Azure DevOps from a Git command line or IDE.  A: No, a user can join only the organization for which the user paid for Basic access. But a user can join any organization where free users with Basic access are still available. The user can also join as a user with Stakeholder access for free.  A: Make sure that users have the correct access level assigned to them. Learnhow to manage users and access levels for Azure DevOps. Learnhow to change access levels for Azure DevOps Server. Some features are available only as extensions. You need to install these extensions. Most extensions require you to have at least Basic access, not Stakeholder access. Check the extension's description in theVisual Studio Marketplace, Azure DevOps tab. For example, to search your code, you can install the freeCode Search extension, but you need at least Basic access to use the extension. To help your team improve app quality, you can install the freeTest & Feedback extension, but you get different capabilities based on your access level and whether you work offline or connected to Azure DevOps Services. SomeVisual Studio subscriberscan use this feature for free, but Basic users need to upgrade to Basic + Test Plans access before they can create test plans.  A: A user can lose access for the following reasons (although the user can continue towork as a Stakeholder): The user's Visual Studio subscription expired. Meanwhile, the user canwork as a Stakeholder, or you can give the user Basic access until the user renews their subscription. After the user signs in, Azure DevOps restores access automatically. The Azure subscription used for billing is no longer active. All purchases made with this subscription are affected, including Visual Studio subscriptions. To fix this issue, visit theAzure account portal. The Azure subscription used for billing was removed from your organization. For more information, seeLink your organization. Your organization has more users with Basic access than the number of users that you're paying for in Azure. Your organization includes five free users with Basic access.

If your organization has users who don't need access anymore,remove them from your organization.  A: If a user is in more than one Microsoft Entra group, aDENYpermission set in one group applies to the user in all groups the user is in. Because the permission is set toDENYfor the user at the lowest possible level, the user's usage of the resource is affected in all groups they are in because denial always takes precedence. For example, if a user is in the Contributor group and in the Project Administrator group andDENYis set for a specific permission in the Contributor group, that permission is denied for the user in the Project Administrator group, too.

A: Group rule types are ranked in the following order: Subscriber > Basic + Test Plans > Basic > Stakeholder.
Users always get the best access level between all the group rules, including Visual Studio subscription. See the following examples, showing how the subscriber detection factors into group rules. Example 1: group rule gives me more access. If I have a Visual Studio Pro subscription and I'm in a group rule that gives me Basic + Test Plans â€“ what happens? Expected: I get Basic + Test Plans because what the group rule gives me is greater than my subscription. Example 2: group rule gives me the same access. I have a Visual Studio Test Pro subscription and I'm in a group rule that gives me Basic + Test Plans what happens? Expected: I get detected as a Visual Studio Test Pro subscriber, because the access is the same as the group rule, and I'm already paying for the Visual Studio Test Pro, so I don't want to pay again.  A: Your organization is free for the first five users with Basic access. You can add unlimited Stakeholders and Visual Studio subscribers for no extra charge. After you assign all five free users with Basic access, you can continue adding Stakeholders and Visual Studio subscribers. To add six or more users with Basic access, you need toset up billing in Azure.

What licenses do we need to use Microsoft Entra B2B?,"For information about what licenses your organization needs to use Microsoft Entra B2B, see  External ID pricing .","Microsoft Entra ID is a cloud-based identity and access management solution. It's a directory and identity management service that operates in the cloud and offers authentication and authorization services to various Microsoft services, such as Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and Microsoft Azure. For more information, seeWhat is Microsoft Entra ID? To access the Microsoft Entra admin center or the Azure portal, each user needs permissions with a valid subscription. If you don't have a paid Microsoft 365 or Microsoft Entra subscription, you need to activate a freeMicrosoft Entra Accountor establish a paid subscription. All Azure subscriptions, whether paid or free, have a trust relationship with a Microsoft Entra tenant. All subscriptions rely on the Microsoft Entra tenant (directory) to authenticate and authorize security principals and devices. For more information, seeHow Azure subscriptions are associated with Microsoft Entra ID. Microsoft Entra ID provides you with common identity and access capabilities to all web services. Whether you're using Microsoft services, such as Microsoft 365, Power Platform, Dynamics 365, or other Microsoft products, you're already using Microsoft Entra ID to help turn on sign-on and access management for all cloud services. All users who are set up to use Microsoft services are defined as user accounts in one or more Microsoft Entra instances, providing these accounts access to Microsoft Entra ID. For more information, seeMicrosoft Entra ID Plans & Pricing Microsoft Entra paid services, such as Enterprise Mobility + Security (Microsoft Enterprise Mobility + Security) complement other Microsoft services like Microsoft 365, with comprehensive enterprise-scale development, management, and security solutions. For more information, see TheMicrosoft Cloud. By default, the person who signs up for a Microsoft Entra or Azure subscription is assigned the Owner role for Azure resources. An Owner can use either a Microsoft account or a work or school account from the directory that the Microsoft Entra or Azure subscription is associated with. This role is also authorized to manage services in the Azure portal. If others need to sign in and access services by using the same subscription, you can assign them the appropriatebuilt-in role. For more information, seeAssign Azure roles using the Azure portal. By default, the user who creates a Microsoft Entra tenant is automatically assigned theGlobal Administratorrole. This user has access to all Microsoft Entra directory features. Microsoft Entra ID has a different set of administrator roles to manage the directory and identity-related features. These administrators have access to various features in the Azure portal. The administrator's role determines what they can do, like create or edit users, assign administrative roles to others, reset user passwords, manage user licenses, or manage domains. For more information, seeAssign a user to administrator roles in Microsoft Entra IDandAssigning administrator roles in Microsoft Entra ID. No.  This isn't currently available. To optimize connectivity between your network and the Microsoft Entra admin center and its services, you might want to add specific Microsoft Entra admin center URLs to your allowlist. Doing so can improve performance and connectivity between your local- or wide area network. Network administrators often deploy proxy servers, firewalls, or other devices, which can help secure and give control over how users access the internet. Rules designed to protect users can sometimes block or slow down legitimate business-related internet traffic. This traffic includes communications between you and Microsoft Entra admin center over the following URLs: For more information, seeUsing Microsoft Entra application proxy to publish on-premises apps for remote users. Additional URLs that you should include are listed in the articleAllow the Azure portal URLs on your firewall or proxy server. You can usually leave an organization on your own without having to contact an administrator. However, in some cases this option isn't available and you need to contact your tenant admin, who can delete your account in the external organization. For more information, seeLeave an organization as an external user. You can connect your on-premises directory to Microsoft Entra ID by using Microsoft Entra Connect. For more information, seeIntegrating your on-premises identities with Microsoft Entra ID. You only need to set up single sign-on (SSO) between your on-premises directory and Microsoft Entra ID. As long as you access your cloud applications through Microsoft Entra ID, the service automatically drives your users to correctly authenticate with their on-premises credentials. Implementing SSO from on-premises can be easily achieved with federation solutions such as Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), or by configuring password hash sync. You can easily deploy both options by using the Microsoft Entra Connect configuration wizard. For more information, seeIntegrating your on-premises identities with Microsoft Entra ID. Yes, Microsoft Entra ID provides you with theMicrosoft Entra ID Access Panelfor user self-service and application access. If you're a Microsoft 365 customer, you can find many of the same capabilities in theOffice 365 portal. For more information, seeIntroduction to the Access Panel. Yes. The Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 edition provides you with Microsoft Entra Connect Health. Microsoft Entra Connect Health helps you monitor and gain insight into your on-premises identity infrastructure and the synchronization services. For more information, seeMonitor your on-premises identity infrastructure and synchronization services in the cloud. (For example, is it possible to use Microsoft Entra self-service password reset (SSPR) with password write-back and not store passwords in the cloud?) This example scenario doesn't require the on-premises password to be tracked in Microsoft Entra. This is because you don't need to synchronize your Active Directory passwords to Microsoft Entra ID to enable write-back. In a federated environment, Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) relies on the on-premises directory to authenticate the user. Password write-back operates in real time. For more information, seeGetting started with password management. Yes, if you have password write-back enabled, the password operations performed by an admin are written back to your on-premises environment. For more answers to password-related questions, seePassword management frequently asked questions. There are a couple of options. You can use the self-service password reset (SSPR) if it's available. Whether SSPR works depends on how it's configured.  For more information about resetting Microsoft Entra passwords, seeHow does the password reset portal work. For Microsoft 365 users, your admin can reset the password by using the steps outlined inReset user passwords. For Microsoft Entra accounts, admins can reset passwords by using one of the following: Microsoft Entra ID uses a more sophisticated strategy to lock accounts. This is based on the IP of the request and the passwords entered. The duration of the lockout also increases based on the likelihood that it's an attack. Rejected passwords return the message 'This password has been used too many times'. This refers to passwords that are globally common, such as any variants of ""Password"" and ""123456"". We do have a gateway that filters requests and provides some protection from botnets, and is applied for all B2C tenants. Microsoft Entra ID has more than 2,600 pre-integrated applications from Microsoft, application service providers, and partners. All pre-integrated applications support single sign-on (SSO). SSO lets you use your organizational credentials to access your apps. Some of the applications also support automated provisioning and de-provisioning. For a complete list of the pre-integrated applications, see theAzure Marketplace. With Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2, you can add and configure any application that you want. Depending on your application's capabilities and your preferences, you can configure SSO and automated provisioning. For more information, seeSingle sign-on SAML protocolandDevelop and plan provisioning for a SCIM endpoint. Microsoft Entra ID provides several ways for users to view and access their applications, such as: For more information, seeEnd user experiences for applications. Microsoft Entra ID supports many standardized protocols for authentication and authorization, such as SAML 2.0, OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, and WS-Federation. Microsoft Entra ID also supports password vaulting and automated sign-in capabilities for apps that only support forms-based authentication. For more information, seeIdentity fundamentalsandSingle sign-on for applications in Microsoft Entra ID. Microsoft Entra application proxyprovides you with easy and secure access to on-premises web applications that you choose. You can access these applications in the same way that you access your software as a service (SaaS) apps in Microsoft Entra ID. There's no need for a VPN or to change your network infrastructure. For more information, seeHow to provide secure remote access to on-premises applications. WithMicrosoft Entra Conditional Access, you can assign a unique access policy for each application. In your policy, you can require multifactor authentication always, or when users aren't connected to the local network. For more information, seeSecuring access to Microsoft 365 and other apps connected to Microsoft Entra ID. Use Microsoft Entra ID to automate the creation, maintenance, and removal of user identities in many popular cloud SaaS apps. For more information, seeWhat is app provisioning in Microsoft Entra ID?. No. Microsoft Entra ID doesn't support the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) protocol or Secure LDAP directly. However, it's possible to enable Microsoft Entra Domain Services instance on your Microsoft Entra tenant with properly configured network security groups through Azure Networking to achieve LDAP connectivity. For more information, seeConfigure secure LDAP for a Microsoft Entra Domain Services managed domain.

What happens if I invite a user whose email and UPN donât match?,"It depends. By default, Microsoft Entra-only allows UPN for login ID. When UPN and email are the same, Microsoft Entra B2B invitations and subsequent sign-ins work as expected. However, issues can arise when a userâs email and UPN donât match, and the email is used instead of the UPN to sign in.
When a user is invited with a non-UPN email, they will be able to redeem the invitation if they redeem using the  email invitation link , but redemptions via a  direct link  will fail. However, even if the user successfully redeems the invitation, subsequent sign-in attempts using the non-UPN email will fail unless the identity provider (either Microsoft Entra ID or a federated identity provider) is configured to allow email as an alternative login ID.
This issue can be mitigated by: 
 
 Enabling email as an alternate login ID  in the invited/home Microsoft Entra tenant 
 Enabling the federated identity provider to support email as login ID (if Microsoft Entra ID is federated to another identity provider) or 
 Instructing the user to redeem/sign-in using their UPN. 
 
 To avoid this issue entirely, administrators should ensure usersâ UPN and email are the same value. 
 
 
 
 Note 
 Invitations and redemptions being sent across Microsoft clouds must use UPN. Email is not supported at this time. For example, if a user from a US Government tenant is invited to a Commercial tenant, the user must be invited using their UPN. 
","Windows 10 or newer devices that are Microsoft Entra hybrid joined don't show up underUSER devices.
Use theAll devicesview. You can also use a PowerShellGet-MgDevicecmdlet. Only the following devices are listed underUSER devices: Go toAll devices. Search for the device by using the device ID. Check the value under the join type column. Sometimes, the device might be reset or reimaged. So it's essential to also check the device registration state on the device: For troubleshooting information, see these articles: Windows clients fetch the PRT from Microsoft Entra ID if the user and the device belong to the same tenant. Users don't get a PRT for another tenant if the device isn't registered or the user isn't a member there. If the two tenants trust each other via B2B, you can always create cross tenant B2B access and trust device claims from your home tenant. The device join state, shown bydeviceID, must match the state on Microsoft Entra ID and meet any evaluation criteria for Conditional Access.
For more information, seeRequire managed devices for cloud app access with Conditional Access. On Windows 10/11 devices joined or registered with Microsoft Entra ID, users are issued aPrimary refresh token (PRT)which enables single sign-on. The validity of the PRT is based on the validity of the device itself. Users see this message if the device is either deleted or disabled in Microsoft Entra ID without initiating the action from the device itself. A device can be deleted or disabled in Microsoft Entra one of the following scenarios: This operation is by design. In this case, the device doesn't have access to resources in the cloud. Administrators can perform this action for stale, lost, or stolen devices to prevent unauthorized access. If this action was performed unintentionally, you need to re-enable or re-register the device using the steps that follow: If the device was disabled in Microsoft Entra ID, an administrator with sufficient privileges can enable it in the Microsoft Entra admin center. Note If you're syncing devices using Microsoft Entra Connect, Microsoft Entra hybrid joined devices will be automatically re-enabled during the next sync cycle. So, if you need to disable a Microsoft Entra hybrid joined device, you need to disable it from your on-premises AD. If the device is deleted in Microsoft Entra ID, you need to re-register the device. To re-register, you must take a manual action on the device. See the following steps for instructions to re-register based on the device state. To re-register Microsoft Entra hybrid joined Windows 10/11 and Windows Server 2016/2019 devices, take the following steps: For Microsoft Entra joined devices Windows 10/11 devices, take the following steps: For Microsoft Entra registered Windows 10/11 devices, take the following steps: Windows 10/11 device registration is only supported for FIPS-compliant TPM 2.0 and not supported for TPM 1.2. If your devices have FIPS-compliant TPM 1.2, you must disable them before proceeding with Microsoft Entra join or Microsoft Entra hybrid join. Microsoft doesn't provide any tools for disabling FIPS mode for TPMs as it is dependent on the TPM manufacturer. Contact your hardware OEM for support. It takes up to an hour for a revoke to be applied from the time the Microsoft Entra device is marked as disabled. Note For enrolled devices, we recommend that you wipe the device to make sure users can't access the resources. For more information, seeWhat is device enrollment?. Microsoft Entra ID added support for multiple Microsoft Entra accounts starting in Windows 10 1803 release. However, Windows 10/11 restricts the number of Microsoft Entra accounts on a device to 3 to limit the size of token requests and enable reliable single sign-on (SSO). Once three accounts are added, users see an error for subsequent accounts. The additional problem information on the error screen provides the following message indicating the reason - ""Add account operation is blocked because account limit is reached"". The Microsoft Entra Device Registration Service issues the MS-Organization-Access certificates during the device registration process. These certificates are issued to all join types supported on Windows - Microsoft Entra joined, Microsoft Entra hybrid joined and Microsoft Entra registered devices. Once issued, they're used as part of the authentication process from the device to request a Primary Refresh Token (PRT). For Microsoft Entra joined and Microsoft Entra hybrid joined devices, this certificate is present in Local Computer\Personal\Certificates whereas for Microsoft Entra registered devices, certificate is present in Current User\Personal\Certificates. All MS-Organization-Access certificates have a default lifetime of 10 years. These certificates are deleted from the corresponding certificate store when the device is unregistered from Microsoft Entra ID. Any inadvertent deletion of this certificate leads to authentication failures for the user, and requiring re-registration of the device in such cases. For pure Microsoft Entra joined devices, make sure you have an offline local administrator account or create one. You can't sign in with any Microsoft Entra user credentials. Next, go toSettings>Accounts>Access Work or School. Select your account and selectDisconnect. Follow the prompts and provide the local administrator credentials when prompted. Reboot the device to finish the unjoin process. Yes. Windows has a cached username and password capability that allows users who signed in previously to access the desktop quickly even without network connectivity. When a device is deleted or disabled in Microsoft Entra ID, it's not known to the Windows device. So users who signed in previously continue to access the desktop with the cached username and password. But as the device is deleted or disabled, users can't access any resources protected by device-based Conditional Access. Users who didn't sign in previously can't access the device. There's no cached username and password enabled for them. Yes, but only for a limited time. When a user is deleted or disabled in Microsoft Entra ID, it's not immediately known to the Windows device. So users who signed in previously can access the desktop with the cached username and password. Typically, the device is aware of the user state in less than four hours. Then Windows blocks those users' access to the desktop. As the user is deleted or disabled in Microsoft Entra ID, all their tokens are revoked. So they can't access any resources. Deleted or disabled users who didn't sign in previously can't access a device. There's no cached username and password enabled for them. No, currently, guest users can't sign in to a Microsoft Entra joined device. Organizations can choose todeploy Windows Server Hybrid Cloud Print with Pre-AuthenticationorUniversal Printfor their Microsoft Entra joined devices. SeeConnect to remote Microsoft Entra joined PC. Did you configure Conditional Access policies to require a specific device state? If the device doesn't meet the criteria, users are blocked, and they see that message.
Evaluate your Conditional Access policies. Make sure the device meets the criteria to avoid the message. Common reasons for this scenario are as follows: Currently, Microsoft Entra joined devices don't force users to change password on the lock screen. So, users with temporary or expired passwords will be forced to change passwords only when they access an application (that requires a Microsoft Entra token) after they log in to Windows. This error happens when you set up Microsoft Entra autoenrollment with Intune without proper license assigned. Make sure that the user who tries to Microsoft Entra join has the correct Intune license assigned. For more information, seeSet up enrollment for Windows devices. A likely cause is that you signed in to the device by using the local built-in administrator account.
Create a different local account before you use Microsoft Entra join to finish the setup. The P2P Server application is application registered by Microsoft Entra ID to enable Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections to any Microsoft Entra joined or Microsoft Entra hybrid joined Windows devices in your tenant. This application creates a tenant wide certificate issued by Microsoft Entra's certificate authority and is used to issue RDP device and user certificates for RDP connectivity. To ensure this is the correct application, you can find theObject IDof the P2P Server application in theMicrosoft Entra admin center>Applications>Enterprise Applications. Remove the default filter applied do you can see all applications. Compare thisObject IDusing the Microsoft Graph API to query for the details usingGET /servicePrincipals/{objectid}and confirm that the servicePrincipalNames property isurn:p2p_cert. Microsoft Entra ID issues the MS-Organization-P2P-Access certificates to Microsoft Entra joined and Microsoft Entra hybrid joined devices. These certificates are used to enable trust between devices in the same tenant for remote desktop scenarios. One certificate is issued to the device and another is issued to the user. The device certificate is present inLocal Computer\Personal\Certificatesand is valid for one day. This certificate is renewed (by issuing a new certificate) if the device is still active in Microsoft Entra ID. The user certificate isn't persistent and is valid for one hour, it's issued on-demand when a user attempts a remote desktop session to another Microsoft Entra joined device. It isn't renewed on expiry. Both these certificates are issued using the MS-Organization-P2P-Access certificate present in theLocal Computer\AAD Token Issuer\Certificates. Microsoft Entra ID issues this certificate during device registration. It isn't possible to disable or expire previous cached logons on Microsoft Entra joined devices. For Microsoft Entra hybrid joined devices, make sure to turn off automatic registration in AD using theControlled validationarticle. Then the scheduled task doesn't register the device again. Next, open a command prompt as an administrator and enterdsregcmd.exe /debug /leave. Or run this command as a script across several devices to unjoin in bulk. For troubleshooting information, see these articles: When your users add their accounts to apps on a domain-joined device, they might be prompted withAdd account to Windows?If they enterYeson the prompt, the device registers with Microsoft Entra ID. The trust type is marked as Microsoft Entra registered. After you enable Microsoft Entra hybrid join in your organization, the device also gets Microsoft Entra hybrid joined. Then two device states show up for the same device. In most cases, Microsoft Entra hybrid join takes precedence over the Microsoft Entra registered state, resulting in your device being considered Microsoft Entra hybrid joined for any authentication and Conditional Access evaluation. However, sometimes, this dual state can result in a nondeterministic evaluation of the device and cause access issues. We strongly recommend upgrading to Windows 10 version 1803 and above where we automatically clean up the Microsoft Entra registered state. Learn how toavoid or clean up this dual state on the Windows 10 machine. UPN changes are supported with Windows 10 2004 update and also applicable to Windows 11. Users on devices with this update won't have any issues after changing their UPNs. UPN changes on older versions of Windows 10 aren't fully supported with Microsoft Entra hybrid joined devices. While users can sign in to the device and access their on-premises applications, authentication with Microsoft Entra ID fails after a UPN change. As a result, users have SSO and Conditional Access issues on their devices. You need to unjoin the device from Microsoft Entra ID (run ""dsregcmd /leave"" with elevated privileges) and rejoin (happens automatically) to resolve the issue. No, except when the user's password is changed. After Windows 10/11 Microsoft Entra hybrid join is complete, and the user signs in at least once, the device doesn't require line of sight to the domain controller to access cloud resources. Windows 10/11 can get single sign-on to Microsoft Entra applications from anywhere with an internet connection, except when a password is changed. Users who sign in with Windows Hello for Business continue to get single sign-on to Microsoft Entra applications even after a password change, even if they don't have line of sight to their domain controller. If a password is changed outside the corporate network (for example, by using Microsoft Entra SSPR), then the user sign-in with the new password fails. For Microsoft Entra hybrid joined devices, on-premises Active Directory is the primary authority. When a device doesn't have line of sight to a domain controller, it's unable to validate the new password. The user needs to establish a connection with the domain controller (either via VPN or being in the corporate network) before they're able to sign in to the device with their new password. Otherwise, they can only sign in with their old password because of cached sign-in capability in Windows. Microsoft Entra invalidates the old password during token requests. This invalidation process prevents single sign-on and fails any device-based Conditional Access policies until the user authenticates with their new password in an app or browser. This issue doesn't occur if you use Microsoft Entra joined devices. For Windows 10 version 2004 and older, this process can be automated with theWorkplace Join (WPJ) removal tool. Note This tool removes all SSO accounts on the device. After this operation, all applications will lose SSO state, and the device will be unenrolled from management tools (MDM) and unregistered from the cloud. The next time an application tries to sign in, users will be asked to add the account again. Enable the following registry to block your users from adding other work accounts to your corporate domain joined, Microsoft Entra joined, or Microsoft Entra hybrid joined Windows 10/11 devices. This policy can also be used to block domain joined machines from inadvertently getting Microsoft Entra registered with the same user account.
